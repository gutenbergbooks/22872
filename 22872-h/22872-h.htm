<p class="center">MAN'S PROPOSAL</p>


<p>Susan Clegg had dwelt alone ever
since her father's death. She had not
been unhappy in dwelling alone, although
she had been a good daughter as long as
she had a parent to live with. When the
parent departed, and indeed some few days
before his going, there had arisen a kind
of a question as to the possibility of a life-companion
for the daughter who must
inevitably be left orphaned and lonely
before long. The question had arisen in a
way highly characteristic of Miss Clegg and
had been disposed of in the same manner.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>The fact is that Miss Clegg had herself proposed
to four men and been refused four
times. Then her father had died, and, upon
the discovery that he was better endowed
with worldly wealth than folks had generally
supposed, all four had hastened to
bring a return suit at once. But Miss
Clegg had also had her mind altered by the
new discovery and refused them all. From
that time to this period of which I am about
to write there had never been any further
question in her mind as to the non-advisability
of having a man in the house.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> See "Susan Clegg and her Friend Mrs. Lathrop."</p></div>

<p>"As far as I can see," she said confidentially
to her friend, Mrs. Lathrop, who lived
next door, "men are not what they are
cracked up to be. There ain't but one
woman as looks happy in this whole community
and that's Mrs. Sperrit, an' she
looks so happy that at first glance she looks
full as much like a fool as anythin'. The
minister's wife don't look happy,&mdash;she
looks a deal more like somethin' a cat finds
an' lugs home for you to brush up,&mdash;an'
goodness knows Mrs. Fisher don't look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
happy an' she ain't happy neither, for she
told me herself yesterday as since Mr.
Fisher had got this new idea of developin'
his chest with Japanese Jimmy Jig-songs,
an' takin' a cold plunge in the slop jar
every mornin', that life hadn't been worth
livin' for the wall paper in her room. She
ain't got no sympathy with chest developin'
an' Japanese jiggin' an' she says only to
think how proud she was to marry the
prize boy at school an' look at what's come
of it. She asked me if I hear about his
goin' to town the other day an' buyin' a
book on how to make your hair grow by
pullin' it out as fast as it comes in, an' then
gettin' on the train, an' gettin' to readin'
on to how to make your eyebrows grow by
pullin' them out, too, an' not noticin' that
they'd unhooked his car an' left it behind,
until it got too dark to read any further&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, what&mdash;" cried Mrs. Lathrop, who
was the best of listeners, and never interjectional
except under the highest possible
pressure of curiosity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>"There was n't nothin' for him to do
except to put his thumb in at the place
where the eyebrows was, an' get down out
of the car, an' then she told me, would you
believe that with her an' John Bunyan in
their second hour of chasin' around like a
pair of crazy cockroaches because he was n't
on the city train when he said he'd come,
he very calmly went up to a hotel an' took
a room for the night? An' she says that
ain't the worst of it whatever you may
think, for he was so interested in the book
that he wanted to keep right on readin', an'
as the light was too high an' he had n't
no way to lower it, he just highered himself
by puttin' a rockin'-chair (yes, Mrs.
Lathrop, a rockin'-chair!) on the center
table, an' there he sit rockin' an' readin'
until he felt to go to bed. She says,
would n't that drive a good wife right out
beside her own mind? To think of a man
like Mr. Fisher rockin' away all night on
top of a table an' never even gettin' a
scare. Why, she says you know an' I know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
that if he'd been the husband of a poor
widow or the only father of a deserving
family, of course he'd have rocked off an'
goodness knows what, but bein' as he was
<i>her</i> husband with a nice life insurance an'
John Bunyan wild to go to college, he needs
must strike the one rocker in the world as is
hung true, an' land safe an' sound in her
sorrowin' arms the next mornin'! Oh
my, but she says, the shock she got!
They was so sure that somethin' had happened
to him that she an' John had planned
a little picnic trip to the city to leave word
with the police first an' visit the Zo&ouml;logical
Gardens after. Well, she says, maybe you
can judge of their feelin's when they was
waitin' all smiles an' sunshine for their
train, with a nice lunch done up under
John's arm, an' he got down from the other
train without no preparation a <i>tall</i>. She
said she done all she could under the circumstances,
for she burst out cryin' in
spite of herself, an' cryin' is somethin' as
always fits in handy anywhere, an' then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
she says they had nothin' in the wide world
to do but to go home an' explain away the
hard-boiled eggs for dinner the best they
could. She says she hopes the Lord'll forgive
her for He knows better than she ever
will what she ever done to have Mr. Fisher
awarded to her as her just and lawful
punishment these last five and twenty
years; an', she says, will you only think
how awful easy, as long as he got on the
table of his own free will an' without her
even puttin' him up to it, it would have
been for him to of rocked off an' goodness
knows what. She says she is a Christian,
an' she don't wish even her husband any
ill wind, but she did frighten me, Mrs.
Lathrop, an' I wanted to speak out frank
an' open to you about it because a man in
the house <i>is</i> a man in the house, an' I want
to take men into very careful consideration
before I go a step further towards
lettin one have the right to darken my
doors whenever he comes home to bed an'
board&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Lathrop quite jumped in her chair
at this startling finale to her neighbor's
talk and her little black eyes gleamed
brightly.</p>

<p>"Bed and bo&mdash;" she cried.</p>

<p>"He'll have father's room, if I take him,
of course," said Susan, "but I ain't sure
yet that I'll take him. You know all I
stood with father, Mrs. Lathrop, an' I don't
really know as I can stand any more sad
memories connected with that room. You
know how it was with Jathrop yourself,
too, an' how happy and peaceful life has
been since he lit out, an' I ain't sure that&mdash;My
heavens alive! I forgot to tell you that
Mr. Dill thought he saw Jathrop in the
city when he was up there yesterday!"</p>

<p>"Saw Ja&mdash;" screamed Mrs. Lathrop.
Jathrop was her son who had fled from the
town some years before, his departure
being marked by peculiarly harrowing circumstances,
and of whom or from whom
she had never heard one word since.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dill was n't sure," said Susan; "he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
said the more he thought about it the more
sure he was that he was n 't sure a <i>tall</i>. He
saw the man in a seed-office where he went
to buy some seed, an' he said if it <i>was</i>
Jathrop he's took another name because
another name was on the office door. He
said what made him think as it was Jathrop
was he jumped so when he see Mr. Dill.
Mr. Dill said he was helpin' himself out of
a box of cigars an' his own idea was as he
jumped because they was n't his cigars.
Jathrop give Mr. Dill one cigar an' when
he thanked him he said, 'Don't mention it,'
an' to my order of thinkin' that proves as
they was n't his cigars, for if they was his
cigars why under heaven should he have
minded Mr. Dill's mentionin' it? Mr. Dill
said another reason as made him think as it
was Jathrop was as he never asked about
you,&mdash;but then if he was n't Jathrop he
naturally would n't have asked about you
either. Mr. Dill said he was n't sure, Mr.
Dill said he was n't a bit sure, Mr. Dill
said it was really all a mystery to him, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
two things he <i>could</i> swear to, an' one of
those was as this man is a full head
taller than Jathrop an' the other was as
he's a Swede, so I guess it's pretty safe not
to be him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lathrop collapsed limply. Susan
went on with her tale as calmly as ever.</p>

<p>"You see, Mrs. Lathrop, it's like this. I
told Mr. Kimball I'd think it over an' consult
you before I give him any answer a
<i>tall</i>. I could see he did n't want to give
me time to think it over or to consult you
for fear I'd change my mind, but when
you ain't made up your mind, changin' it
is easy, an' I never was one to hurry myself
an' I won't begin now. Hurryin' leads
to swallowin' fish-bones an' tearin' yourself
on nails an' a many other things as makes
me mad, an' I won't hurry now an' I won't
hurry never. I shall take my own time,
an' take my own time about takin' it, too,
an' Mr. Kimball nor no other man need n't
think he can ask me things as is more likely
to change my whole life than not to change<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
it, an' suppose I'm goin' to answer him like
it was n't no greater matter than a sparrow
hoppin' his tail around on a fence. I
ain't no sparrow nor no spring chicken
neither an' I don't intend to decide my
affairs jumpin' about in a hurry, no, not
even if you was advisin' me the same as
Mr. Kimball, Mrs. Lathrop, an' you know
how much I think of your advice even if
you have yet to give me the first piece as
I can see my way to usin', for I will say this
for your advice, Mrs. Lathrop, an' that is
that advice as is easier left untook than
yours is, never yet was given."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lathrop opened her mouth in a
feeble attempt to rally her forces, but long
before they were rallied Susan was off
again:</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure, whether what
I said to Mr. Kimball in the end was wise
or not. I did n't say right out as I would,
but I said I would maybe for a little while.
I thought a little while would give me the
inside track of what a long while would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
pretty sure to mean. I don't know as it
was a good thing to do but it's done now,
so help me Heaven; an' if I can't stand
him I always stand by my word, so he'll
get three months' board anyhow an' I'll
learn a little of what it would mean to
have a man in the house."</p>

<p>"A man in&mdash;" cried Mrs. Lathrop, recovering
herself sufficiently to illustrate her
mental attitude by what in her case always
answered the purposes of a start.</p>

<p>"That's what I said," said Susan, "an'
havin' said it Mr. Kimball can rely on
Elijah Doxey's bein' sure to get it now."</p>

<p>"Eli&mdash;" cried Mrs. Lathrop, again upheaved.</p>

<p>"Elijah Doxey," repeated Susan.
"That's his name. I ain't surprised over
your bein' surprised, Mrs. Lathrop, 'cause
I was all dumb did up myself at first. I
never was more dumb or more did up since
I was a baby, but after the way as Mr.
Kimball sprung shock after shock on me
last night I got so paralyzed in the end
that his name cut very little figger beside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
our havin' a newspaper of our own, right
here in our midst, an' me havin' the editor
to board an' him bein' Mr. Kimball's
nephew, an' Mr. Kimball havin' a nephew
as was a editor, an' Mr. Kimball's never
havin' seen fit to mention the fact to any
of us in all these many years as we've been
friends on an' off an' us always buyin'
from him whenever we was n't more friends
with Mr. Dill."</p>

<p>"I nev&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"No, nor no one else ever heard of him
neither. The first of it all was when he
came up last night to see would I board
him, an' of course when I understood as it
was me as was goin' to have to take him
in I never rested till I knowed hide an'
hair of who I was to take in down to the
last button on Job's coat."</p>

<p>"And wh&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you all I found out myself;
an' I tell you I worked hard findin'
it out too, for Mr. Kimball is no windmill
to pump when it comes to where he gets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
relations from. Seems, Mrs. Lathrop, as
he had a sister though as married a Doxey
an' that's the why of Elijah Doxey. Seems
Elijah is so smart that he'll be offered a
place on one of the biggest city papers in
a little while, but in the mean time he's
just lost the place that he did have on one
of the smallest ones an', as a consequence,
his mother thought he'd better spend this
summer in the country an' so sent him up
to Mr. Kimball. Mr. Kimball said he really
did n't sense all it meant at first when
Elijah arrived at noon yesterday but he
said he had n't talked with him long afore
he see as this was our big chance 'cause
the paper as Elijah was on paid him off
with a old printin' press, an' Mr. Kimball
says, if we back him up, we can begin
right now to have a paper of our own an'
easy get to be what they call a 'state issue.'
It's easy seen as Mr. Kimball is all ready to
be a state issue; he says the printin' press
is a four horse-power an' he's sure as he
can arrange for Hiram Mullins to work the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
wringer the day he goes to press. Mr.
Kimball says he's positive that Hiram 'll
regard it as nothin' but child's play to
wring off his grocery bill that way. I don't
know what Gran'ma Mullins will say to
that&mdash;or Lucy either for that matter&mdash;but
Mr. Kimball's so sure that he knows
best that I see it was n't no time to pull
Gran'ma Mullins an' Lucy in by the ears.
Mr. Kimball says he's been turnin' it over
in his mind's eye ever since yesterday when
he first see Elijah. He says Elijah is just
mad with ideas an' says he 's willin' to
make us known far an' wide if we'll only
give him a chance. Mr. Kimball says we
all ought to feel ready to admit that it's
time we was more than a quarter of a
column a week in the <i>Meadville Mixture</i>.
He says the <i>Meadville Mixture</i> ain't never
been fair to us an' Judge Fitch says it
ain't got right views as to its foreign policy.
Mr. Kimball says that after Elijah went
back to town yesterday afternoon he went
up to Judge Fitch's office an' Judge Fitch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
said if we had a paper of our own he'd be
more than willin' to write a editorial occasionally
himself, a editorial as would open
the president's eyes to the true hiddenness
of things, an' set the German emperor to
thinkin', an' give the czar some insight
into what America knows about <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kimball says this is the day of
consolidation an' if we had a paper the
Cherry Ponders an' all the Clightville
people'd naturally join in an' take it too.
He says he's figured that if he can start
out with a hundred paid-up subscribers of
a dollar each he can make a go of it. He
says Elijah says set him up the press an'
<i>he</i> don't ask no better fun than to live on
bread an' water while he jumps from peak
to peak of fame, but Mr. Kimball says
Elijah's young an' limber an' he shall want
the paid-up subscriptions himself afore he
begins to transport a printin' press around
the country.</p>

<p>"I told him he could count on you an'
me takin' one between us before I knowed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
what was really the main object of his
visit, an' then when he come out with
what <i>was</i> the main object of his visit, an'
when I sensed what he was after I must
say I considered as he should have made
that his first word an' give me my paper
for nothin',&mdash;seein' as the whole of the thing
is got to rest right on me, for I don't know
what <i>is</i> the bottom of a newspaper if it
ain't the woman as boards the editor.
Yes, Mrs. Lathrop, that's my view in a
nutshell, the more so as Mr. Kimball
openly says as Elijah Doxey says he's a
genius an' can't live in any house where
there's other folks or any noise but his
own. Mr. Kimball said it seemed as if a
good angel had made me for the town to
turn to in its bitter need an' that it was
on me as the new newspaper would have
to build its reputation in its first sore
strait; an' he said too as he would in confidence
remark as my influence on Elijah's
ideas would be what he should be really
lookin' to to make the paper a success, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
he says as Elijah is very young an' will
be wax in my hands an' I can mold him
an' public opinion right along together.
He said he really did n't look for him to be
any great trouble to feed because he'd be
out pickin' up items most of the time, an'
then too, he says he can always give him
a handful of his new brand of dried apples
as is advertised to be most puffin' an'
fillin'; why, do you know, Mrs. Lathrop,
he told me as he'd developed the process
now to where if you eat two small pieces
you feel like you never wanted another
Thanksgivin' dinner as long as you live."</p>

<p>"And so&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop eagerly,
Susan pausing an instant for breath just
here.</p>

<p>"Well, in the end I said I would, for
three months. I don't know as I was
wise, but I thought it was maybe my duty
for three months. I'm tired of seein' the
Clightville folks called 'Glimpses' an' us
called 'Dabs' in that <i>Meadville Mixture</i>,
an' last week you remember how they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
spelt it wrong an' called us 'Dubs,' which
is far from my idea of politeness. It was
being mad over that as much as anythin'
that made me up an' tell Mr. Kimball as
I'd take Elijah an' take care of him an'
look to do what I could to make the paper
a success for three months. I told him
as it was trustin' in the dark, for Elijah
was a unknown quantity to me an' I never
did like the idea of a man around my nice,
clean house, but I said if he'd name the
Meadville items the 'Mud Spatters' an' so
get even for our feelin's last week I'd do
my part by feedin' him an' makin' up his
bed mornin's. Mr. Kimball said I showed
as my heart an' my brains was both in the
right place, an' then he got up an' shook
hands an' told me as he would in confidence
remark as he expected to make a very good
thing all round for he was gettin' the
printin' press awful cheap and Elijah likewise."</p>

<p>"When&mdash;?" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Next Wednesday. Elijah's comin' up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
freight with the printin' press. Mr. Kimball
says he suggested that himself. He
says it cuts two birds with one knife for it
makes it look as if the printin' press was
extra fine instead of second-hand, an' it
gets Elijah here for nothin'."</p>

<p>"Dear&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"I would, too," said Miss Clegg, "only
you see I have n't got time. I ought not
to be here now. I ought to be over gettin'
his room ready an' takin' out the little
comforts. As far as my order of thinkin'
goes, little comforts is lost on men, Mrs.
Lathrop, they always trip over them an'
smash them in the dark."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center">ELIJAH DOXEY AND HIS LOCKED BOX</p>


<p>"Well," suggested Mrs. Lathrop one
pleasant Saturday morning, a few
days later, when she and her friend met
at the fence. Miss Clegg looked slightly
fretted and more than slightly warm, for
she had been giving her garden an uncommonly
vigorous weeding on account of an
uncommonly vigorous shower which had
fallen the afternoon before. The weeding
had been so strenuous that Miss Clegg was
quite disposed to stop and rest, and as she
joined her neighbor and read the keen
interest that never failed to glow in the
latter's eyes, her own expression softened
slightly and she took up her end of the
conversation with her customary capability
at giving forth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know," she began, "an' Mr.
Kimball don't know either. Elijah was
tellin' me all about it last night. He <i>is</i> a
trouble, Mrs. Lathrop, but I don't know
but what it pays to have a man around
when you can have them to talk to like
I have him. Of course a new broom
sweeps clean an' I've no intention of supposin'
that Elijah will ever keep on coverin'
his soap an' scrapin' his feet long, but
so far so good, an' last night it was real
pleasant to hear the rain an' him together
tellin' how much trouble they're havin',
owin' to Hiram's bein' too energetic
wringin' the handle of the printin' press
an' then to think as when he was all done
talkin' it would be him an' not me as in
common decency would have to go out in
the wet to padlock the chickens. Seems,
Mrs. Lathrop, as they're really havin' no
end o' trouble over the new paper an'
Elijah's real put out. He says Hiram had
a idea as the more the speed the better
the paper an' was just wringin' for dear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
life, an' the first thing he knew the first
issue begin to slide a little cornerways an'
slid off into a crank as Elijah never knowed
was there, an' him an' Mr. Kimball spent
the whole of yesterday runnin' around like
mad an' no way to fix it. As a consequence
Elijah's very much afraid as
there'll be no paper this week an' it's too
bad, for every one is in town spendin' the
day an' waitin' to take it home with them.
Young Dr. Brown is goin' to feel just
awful 'cause he'd bought twenty-five
papers to mail to all his college class.
There was goin' to be a item about him,
an' Mrs. Brown says it was goin' to be a
good one for she fed Elijah mince pie while
he made his notes for it an' had Amelia
play on her guitar, too."</p>

<p>"What do you&mdash;?" began Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't say as I really know <i>what</i>
to think of him just yet. I never see such
a young man afore. He has some very
curious ways, Mrs. Lathrop, ways as make
me feel that I can't tell you positively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
what I do think. Now yesterday was the
first day as I knowed he'd be gone for
long, so I took it to go through all his
things, an' do you know, away down at
the bottom of one of his trunks I found a
box as was locked an' no key anywhere.
Well, Mrs. Lathrop, I hunted, an' I hunted,
an' I hunted, an' I couldn't find that key
a <i>tall</i>. I never had any thin' of that kind
in my house afore an' of course I ain't
goin' to give up without a good deal more
lookin', but if I can't find that key it'll
prove beyond a shadow of a doubt as
Elijah Doxey ain't of a trustin' nature an'
if that's true I don't know how I ever
<i>will</i> be able to get along with him. A
trustin' nature is one thing to have around
an' a distrustin' nature is another thing,
an' I can tell you that there's somethin'
about feelin' as you ain't trusted as makes
me take my hands right out of my bread
dough an' go straight upstairs to begin
lookin' for that key again. The more I
hunt the wilder I get, for it's a very small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
box for a man to keep locked, an' it ain't
his money or jewelry for it don't rattle
when you shake it. It's too bad for me
to feel so because in most other ways he's
a very nice young man, although I will say
as sunset is midnight compared to his hair."</p>

<p>"Do&mdash;" began Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Then too, he said yesterday," Miss
Clegg continued, "as he wanted it distinctly
understood as his things was never
to be touched by no one an' I told him as
he could freely an' frankly rely on me.
Now that's goin' to make it a great deal
more work to hunt for that key from now
on. An' I don't like to have it made any
harder work to find a thing, as I have n't
found yet a <i>tall</i>."</p>

<p>"Wh&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Not me," said Miss Clegg; "I ain't got
any give-up in me. I'll keep on until I
find it if I have to board Elijah Doxey till
he dies or till I drop dead in my huntin'
tracks. But I can see that my feelin'
towards him is n't goin' to be what it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
might of been if he'd been frank an' open
with me as I am with him an' every one
else. He seems so frank an' open, too&mdash;in
other ways than that box. He read his
editorial aloud night afore last an' I must
say it showed a real good disposition for
he even wished the president well although
he said as he knowed he was sometimes
goin' to be obliged to maybe be a little
bit hard on him. He said as plain speakin'
an' to the purpose 'd be the very breath
an' blast of the <i>Megaphone</i> an' he should
found it on truth, honor an' the great
American people, an' carry Judge Fitch
to congress on them lines. I thought as
Judge Fitch would object to goin' to congress
on any lines after all he's said about
what he thought of congress in public,
but Elijah says a new paper must have a
standard, an' he asked Judge Fitch if he
minded being nailed to ours, an' the judge
said he did n't mind nothin' these degenerate
days, so Elijah just up with him."</p>

<p>"Did you&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"See Mrs. Macy?&mdash;yes, I see her in the
square yesterday noon. She was just back
from Meadville. She says the editor of
the <i>Meadville Mixture</i> is awful bitter
over our havin' a paper of our own, an'
says he'll cross tinfoils with Elijah any
day. I told Elijah what she said last night,
but Elijah did n't mind. I hoped tellin'
him'd take his appetite away, but he ate
eleven biscuits just the same. That reminds
me as he's comin' home to dinner
to-day, an' I ought to be goin' in."</p>

<p>"Goo&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>&mdash;"But I'll come over after he goes an'
tell you how the paper's comin' out," Susan
added, as she turned from the fence;
and as she was always true to her promises
she did come over to Mrs. Lathrop's kitchen
after dinner, wearing a clean apron and a
new expression&mdash;an expression of mixed
doubt and displeasure.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lathrop hurried to give her a chair
and make her welcome, and then took a
chair herself and sat at attention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>Susan began at once.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "it's a good thing as
the Fishers are thinkin' some of sendin'
John Bunyan to college, for he's surely a
sight too smart for this town."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lathrop opened her eyes in wide
surprise, as it was certainly not about John
Bunyan that she had expected to hear tales.</p>

<p>"Elijah says as John Bunyan made
them all feel pretty cheap down at the
printin' press this mornin'," Miss Clegg
went on: "seems the whole community
was squeezin' into the back of Mr. Kimball's
store to see what under the sun
could be done to get the first paper out of
the press, when all of a sudden John Bunyan
spoke up an' asked why they did n't
turn the handle backward an' empty the
whole muss out that way. Well, every
one see the sense of what he said right off,
an' so they began, an' as soon as they
began to turn the crank backward the
paper began to come out backward, tore,
of course, but as nice as pie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Elijah says he most thought his
uncle was goin' to take his job as editor
away and give it to John Bunyan right off,
he was so pleased. But Mr. Kimball ain't
the sort of uncle as Elijah so far supposes
himself to of got, an' he only give John
Bunyan fifty cents' worth of soda water
tickets, an' they're to work to-night (if
Lucy'll let Hiram), an' have the paper
ready for church to-morrow. The Jilkins
an' Sperrits was a little disapp'inted 'cause
they was n't comin' in to church, countin'
on stayin' home an' readin' the paper all
day instead, but Elijah's goin' to put in a
late column of late news an' give 'em their
money's worth that way. Mr. Kimball
had arranged to have one whole column of
Ks to draw attention to his dried apples,
an' he's goin' to give it up for the occasion
an' let Elijah write a Extra about the cause
of the delay, for that's really all the late
news there is. Then, too, Elijah's goin' to
have a joke about the paper's comin' in
among us like a man goes into politics,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
kind of slidin' an' turnin' this way an'
that, an' I must say I begin to find some
of Elijah's ideas pretty bright. But my
mind's taken a new turn on his subjeck
from what he said at dinner, an' I will
admit, Mrs. Lathrop, as I see now as I
misjudged him in one way, for he come
an' asked me while I was washin' up if I
knowed any way to open a locked box
without a key, for he could n't find the key
to his flute box nowhere, an' when he was
a little nervous nights he always wore it
off practisin' on his flute. Well, Mrs.
Lathrop, you can maybe imagine as learnin'
as there was a flute in that box an'
the key lost, an' him in the habit of playin'
that flute nights, altered my views more 'n
a little, an' I can tell you that I had to
think pretty fast afore answerin' him.
While I was thinkin' he said he had n't
played since he was here, an' he was gettin'
so wild to play he thought the best
way would be to maybe pry the lock open.
I see then as I'd got to come out firm an'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
I said I'd never consent to no young man
in my house, spoilin' a good box like that
an' maybe a fine flute too, just because he
had n't got a little patience. He said I
was right about its being a fine flute, an'
he was just achin' to hear it an' blow it.
I told him to let me hunt an' maybe I'd
find the key, an' so he went off some
soothed, an' now the Lord have mercy on
you an' me, for Elijah Doxey never will
from this day on. Will you only think
of him bein' nervous an' playin' nights!
It'll be worse than a tree-toad an' you
know what a tree-toad is, Mrs. Lathrop,&mdash;I
declare to goodness if Elijah acts like a
tree-toad he'll drive me stark, ravin' mad."</p>

<p>"Ca&mdash;" suggested Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"I don't see how I can," said Miss Clegg,
dubiously. "I shall do my best, but, oh
my, a young man as is a editor an' has
red hair an' a flute is awful uncertain to
count on. I almost wish I had n't took
him."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't now," said Miss Clegg, "the
arrangements of this world is dreadful hard
on women. It's very easy to take a man
into your house but once a woman has done
it an' the man's settled, nobody but a
undertaker can get him out in any way as
is respectable accordin' to my order of
thinkin'."</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;" suggested Mrs. Lathrop,
comfortingly.</p>

<p>"I know, but even three months is a
long time," said Miss Clegg, "an' he's
begun to leave his soap uncovered already,
an' oh my heavens alive, how am I ever
goin' to stand that flute!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center">THE FIRST ISSUE OF THE NEWSPAPER</p>


<p>"I'll tell you what, Mrs. Lathrop," said
Miss Clegg the next Monday afternoon,
"I ain't goin' to stay here so late but
what I go home in time to make Elijah
something hot an' comfortin' for supper
to-night. I ain't any one to take sides,
but I will say that my heart has gone out
to that poor young man ever since I was
down in the square this mornin'. I felt to
be real glad as he'd took to-day to go
up to the city, for I must say I'd of felt
more'n a little sorry for him if he'd heard
folks expressin' their opinion about his first
paper."</p>

<p>"Did he&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Yes, he went to-day," said Miss Clegg.
"He went on the early train an' one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
joys of havin' a man in the house was as I
had to be up bright an' early to get him
his breakfast. I must say I never thought
about his wantin' early breakfast when I
agreed to take him, but I'm not one to
refuse to feed even a editor, so I cooked
him cakes just the same as I would any
one else."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess maybe he heard things
yesterday as made him feel as it'd be just
as well to let folks have time to sizzle down
some afore they looked on his bright an'
shinin' face again. I tell you what, Mrs.
Lathrop, I can see as runnin' a newspaper
ain't an easy thing an' the town is really
so up in arms to-day, that I really would
of made waffles for Elijah to eat instead of
just plain cakes, if I'd knowed when he got
up how mad every one was at him. I can
see since I've been down town to-day as
the square was n't likely to have been no
bed of roses for him yesterday. The whole
community is mad as hornets over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
paper. Why, I never see folks so mad
over nothin' before. Nobody likes his puttin'
his own name right under the paper's,
an' Dr. Brown says the editor belongs on
the inside, anyhow. Dr. Brown's most
<i>awful</i> mad 'cause Elijah's put his item
right in with the advertisement of Lydia
Finkham, an' he says he ain't nothin' as
pretends to cure anythin' or everybody.
He says he's a regular doctor as you have
to take regular chances with an' he feels
like suin' Elijah for slander. Gran'ma
Mullins is mad, too, 'cause she was put in
the personals an' Elijah went an' called
her the 'Nestor of the crick,' without
never so much as askin' by her leave. She
says she ain't never done nothin' with the
crick, an' if she ever nested anywhere it
was in her own owned an' mortgaged
house. Hiram says he'll punch Elijah if
he ever refers to his mother's nestin' again,
an' I guess Hiram feels kind of sore over
Elijah's talkin' of his mother's nestin' when
all the town knows how much he wishes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
as Lucy'd settle down and nest awhile
instead of keepin' 'em all so everlastin'ly
churned up. Mrs. Macy told me this
mornin' as Lucy's whitewashin' the garret
this week; she see the brush goin' 'round
an' 'round the window on her side&mdash;she
says it makes her bones ache just to live
next door to Lucy's ways. She says
they're so different from Gran'ma Mullins'
ways. Gran'ma Mullins had n't had no
whitewashin' done in twenty years&mdash;not
since she rented the cottage of father.
That's true an' I know it's true too because
she's been askin' an' askin' me to have it
done an' I said not by no means&mdash;so
she's left off."</p>

<p>"Did&mdash;?" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"The Jilkinses is real mad over the paper,
too," Susan continued. "Seems as Elijah
went an' called 'em the 'Chirpy Cherry
Ponders,' an' Mrs. Jilkins says where he
got the idea as either of 'em ever chirped
in their lives she cannot conceive, for Mr.
Jilkins ain't so much as peeped a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
part of the time since they were married
an' she says as for being chirpy, <i>she</i> looks
upon the word as city slang. But Judge
Fitch is about the maddest of all! I
did n't read what Elijah said about him
but every one else did, an' he says he was
willin' to run for congress for the good of
his country, but to put him up in a editorial
as says he'll be proud to come back
from Washington as poor as he goes there,
is a very poor way to put heart into any
man's contest. He says if he's got to come
back from Washington as poor as he goes
he can't see no good an' sufficient reason
for goin' a <i>tall</i>, for he won't gain nothin'
an' will be out his car fare there an' back.
He says he never heard of no one comin'
back from Washington as poor as they
went before, an' it was a thing as he supposed
could n't be done till he found Elijah
had booked him to do it. He says if that's
what he's to up an' teach his country, he
don't thank Elijah for advertisin' him as
any such novelty an' he says he won't go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
to congress on any such terms&mdash;not while
he knows himself. Mr. Kimball told me
as he spoke to Elijah about it yesterday,
an' Elijah said to him as it would be a
strong plank for Judge Fitch to stand on
in the middle of his platform, but Judge
Fitch told Mr. Kimball as he could just
tell his nephew frank an' open as that one
plank in his platform had better be weak
an' he'd take care to remember to step
over it every time. He said he was just
waitin' for a good chance to tell Elijah his
opinion of him right to his face, an' he said
as he should give him to understand as
after this he must submit all other planks
to <i>him</i> afore he printed 'em. Mr. Kimball
says that Judge Fitch said good gracious
him, there would n't be no knowin' what
he'd have to live up to next, if Elijah
was n't reined in tighter. Judge Fitch
says the old way is good enough for him
when he goes to Washington.</p>

<p>"But that ain't all the trouble there is.
Mr. Fisher feels very much hurt at Elijah's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
writin' any editorial without consultin' him
first. He says he told him as he could
have give him a motto out of Shakespeare
about layin' on an' dammin' as would have
put life in the campaign right off at the
beginnin'; an' then there's Mrs. Macy as
thinks he was awful mean to call her one
as carries weight anywhere; I'm sure I
wish Elijah had let Mrs. Macy alone for
she's worse than hornets over that remark
of his. She says maybe Elijah'll go over
two hundred an' fifty hisself some day, an'
if he does he'll know as it's no joke. She
bu'st her rocker last night when she read
what he said about her, an' she says bu'stin'
a rocker ought to show better than any
words how mad it made her. My, she
says, but she was mad! I told Elijah
when he was gettin' up the paper as he'd
better never say nothin' about nobody in
it, but Elijah can't help being a man an'
very like all men in consequence, an' he said
as a paper was n't nothin' without personal
items, an' he thought folks would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
enjoy being dished up tart an' spicy. I
told him my views was altogether different.
'Elijah Doxey,' I says, 'you dish Meadville
up tart an' spicy an' we'll all feel to enjoy,
but you leave folks here alone.' But he
didn't mind me an' now he's got a lesson
as will maybe teach him to leave the armchairs
of folks as is payin' for his paper
unbu'sted henceforth."</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;?" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Oh, we get along pretty well," said
Susan; "a man's a man, an' of course any
house always is pleasanter without one in
it, but I guess if you have to have one
around Elijah's about as little bother as
you could ask. I'm teachin' him to be
real orderly in a hurry just by puttin' his
things where he couldn't possibly find 'em
if he leaves 'em layin' around. You always
can manage pleasantly if you're smart, an'
I'm smart. If he don't empty his basin,
I don't fill his pitcher; if he's late to meals,
I eat up all as is hot;&mdash;oh! there's lots of
ways of gettin' along, an' I try 'em all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
turn an' turn about. If one don't work
another is sure to, an' if he ever does have
a wife it won't be my fault&mdash;I know that.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kimball asked me this mornin'
what I thought of him anyhow. Mr.
Kimball says as Elijah says as he personally
thinks this year is sent to fit him for
suthin' demandin' backbone, an' so he'd
ought to be resigned to anythin'. That
didn't sound just polite to me to my order
of thinkin' an' Gran'ma Mullins come back
just then an' broke in an' said if Elijah
was resigned she wasn't, an' she hoped
he'd never come her way any more when
he was out pickin' up items."</p>

<p>"Is any one&mdash;" began Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Miss Clegg, "I
don't believe so. Even the minister is
mad; I met him comin' home an' I
couldn't see what he had to complain of,
for I didn't remember there bein' a single
word about him in the whole paper. Come
to find out he was all used up 'cause there
<i>wasn't</i> nothin' about him in it. He told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
me in confidence as he never got such a
shock in all his life. He says he read the
paper over nine times afore he was able to
sense it, an' he says his last sermon was on
hidin' your light under a bushel basket an'
he had a copy all ready if Elijah had only
come for it. He says he shall preach next
Sunday on cryin' out unto you to get up,
an' he shall take a copy to Elijah himself.
I cheered him up all I could. I told him
as a sermon preached on Sunday was n't
likely to be no great novelty to no one on
the Saturday after, but I'd see that he got
it back all safe if Elijah throwed it into his
scrap-basket. That seems to be the big
part of bein' a editor&mdash;the throwin' things
in his scrap-basket. Elijah's scrap-basket
is far from bein' the joy of my life for he
tears everythin' just the same way an' it
makes it a long, hard job to piece 'em
together again. Some days I don't get
time an' then I <i>do</i> get so aggravated."</p>

<p>"Have you ever&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop
with real interest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not yet, but he ain't got really started
yet. It's when the paper gets to Meadville
an' Meadville begins to write him
back what they think about what he thinks
of them, that that scrap-basket will be
interestin'! I guess I'll go home now an'
make biscuits for supper. He was comin'
back on the five-o'clock train. Poor Elijah,
he'll have a hard day to-morrow but it'll
do him good. Men never have to clean
house, so the Lord has to discipline their
souls any way he can, I suppose, an' to
my order o' thinkin' this runnin' a newspaper
is goin' to send Elijah a long ways
upwards on his heavenly journey."</p>

<p>"Does&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop, rising
heavily to bid her friend good-bye.</p>

<p>"Most likely," said Susan; "at any rate
if he does n't have any appetite. I like 'em
myself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">SETTLING DOWN AFTER THE HONEYMOON</p>


<p>Miss Clegg and Mrs. Lathrop were
sitting on the latter's steps about
five o'clock one Sunday afternoon when
Elijah Doxey came out of the former's
house and walked away down town.</p>

<p>"I wond&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," said Miss Clegg; "I
know the way you look at it, Mrs. Lathrop,
but <i>I</i> don't believe it. All the girls
is after him but that ain't surprisin' for
girls are made to be after somethin' at
that age an' there's almost nothin' for
them to run down in this community.
We're very short of men to marry, Mrs.
Lathrop, an' what men we have got ain't
tall enough yet to do it, but still, it ain't
no reason why Elijah should be in love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
just because 'Liza Em'ly and all the other
girls is in love with him. To my order o'
thinkin' two sets of people have got to love
to make a marriage, an' 'Liza Em'ly ain't
but one. An' I don't know as I want
Elijah to be in love, anyhow&mdash;not while
he lives in my house. It might lead to
his eatin' less but it would surely lead to
his playin' the flute more, an' that flute
is all I can stand now. He won't marry
if I can help it, I know <i>that</i>, an' I keep his
eagerness down by talkin' to him about
Hiram Mullins all I can, an' surely Hiram
is enough to keep any man from soarin'
into marriage if he can just manage to
hop along single an' in peace."</p>

<p>"Have you&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop,
interestedly.</p>

<p>"Well, I should say I had&mdash;an' it's
fresh on my mind, too. It was yesterday
an' I see 'em both. Lucy come in the
mornin' an' Gran'ma Mullins in the afternoon.
I'd like to of had Hiram come in
the evenin' an' tell his end, but Hiram<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
don't dare say a word to no man nowadays.
As far as my observation's extended
a man as lives steady with two
women gets very meek as to even men.
Hiram's learned as his long suit is to keep
still an' saw wood when he ain't choppin'
it."</p>

<p>"What did&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Well, Lucy come up right after market
an' she said the reason she come was because
she'd just got to talk or bu'st, an'
she was n't anxious to bu'st yet awhile."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Oh, just the usual tale as any one could
o' foreseen if they went an' married Hiram
Mullins. Any one might of easy knowed
as Lucy Dill could n't no more enjoy
Hiram Mullins than a cat could enjoy
swimmin' lessons, but she <i>would</i> have him,
an' she <i>had</i> to have him, an' now she's got
him&mdash;so help her eternity to come."</p>

<p>"Did she&mdash;" questioned Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"No," said Miss Clegg, "she ain't been
married quite long enough for that yet;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
she's only been married long enough to
come out strong an' bitter as to blamin'
Gran'ma Mullins. I will say this for Lucy,
Mrs. Lathrop, an' that is that a fairer thing
than blamin' Gran'ma Mullins for Hiram
could n't be expected of whoever married
Hiram, for it stands to reason as no one
as had brains could marry Hiram an' not
want to begin blamin' his mother five
minutes after. Gran'ma Mullins never did
seem able to look at Hiram with a impartial
eye, an' Lucy says as it beats all kind
of eyes the way she looks at him since he's
got married. Why, Lucy says it's most
made her lose faith in her Bible&mdash;the way
she feels about Gran'ma Mullins. She says
she's got a feelin' towards Gran'ma Mullins
as she never knowed could be in a woman.
She says she's come to where she just cannot
see what Ruth ever stuck to Naomi
for when the husband was dead an' Naomi
disposed to leave, too. She says if anythin'
was to happen to Hiram she'd never
be fool enough to hang onto Gran'ma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Mullins. She sat down an' told me all
about their goin' to town last week. She
says she nigh to went mad. They started
to go to the city just for a day's shoppin'
an' she says it was up by the alarm clock at
four an' breakfast at six for fear of missin'
the nine-o'clock train an' then if Gran'ma
Mullins did n't lose her little black bead
bag with her weddin' ring an' the size of
Hiram's foot an' eighty-five cents in it, so
they could n't get him no bargain socks
after all! All they could do was to buy
the safety razor, an' when they got home
with that there was n't no blade in it, an'
they had to go way back to town next day.
Come to find out the blade was in the box
all the time, done up in the directions, only
Hiram never read the directions, 'cause he
said as it's a well-known fact as you can't
cut yourself with a safety razor whatever
you do.</p>

<p>"Well, Lucy says it's for that sort of
doin's as she left her happy home an' her
razor-stroppin' father, an' she says the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
billin' an' cooin' of Gran'ma Mullins over
Hiram is enough to make a wedded wife
sick. She says she would n't say it to no
one but me, an' I promised her never to
breathe it along any further, but she says
she's beginnin' to question as to how long
she's goin' to be able to stand it all. She
says will you believe that nights Gran'ma
Mullins is comin' in softly at all hours to
tuck up Hiram's feet, an' Lucy's forever
thinkin' she's either a rat or a robber or
else hittin' at her for Hiram himself. She
says as it's Heaven's own truth as Gran'ma
Mullins is warmin' his flannels every Saturday
to this day, an' that the tears stand
in her very eyes when Lucy won't help him
off with his boots."</p>

<p>"I never&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"No, nor no one else. It's all Gran'ma
Mullins' foolishness. She begun to be foolish
when Hiram begun to know things. I
can remember when he used to run everywhere
behind her with a little whip, 'cause
he liked to play horse, an' although she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
used to pretend that she let him 'cause it
kept the moths out of her clothes, still
every one knowed as it was just her spoilin'
of him. Now he's growed up spoiled an'
poor Lucy Dill's got the consequences to
suffer.</p>

<p>"An' Lucy surely is sufferin'! She says
she ain't exactly discouraged, but it's
swimmin' up Niagara Falls to try an' break
either of 'em of their bad habits. She
says she has to look on at kisses until the
very thought of one makes her seasick, an'
she says to see Gran'ma Mullins listenin' to
Hiram singin' is enough to make any one
blush down to the very ground.</p>

<p>"I cheered her all I could. I told her
as you can't make no sort of a purse out
of ears like Hiram's, an' that what can't
be cured has always got to be lived with
unless you're a man. She cried some, poor
thing, an' said her mother always used to
say as Hiram was cut out to make some
girl wish he was dead, but she said she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>always thought as her mother was prejudiced.
She said Hiram had a sort of way
with him before he was married as was so
hopeful, an' he used to look at her an' sigh
till it just went all through her how happy
they'd be if they could only be together
all they wanted to be together. Well, you
c'n believe me or not, just as you please,
Mrs. Lathrop, but she says he ain't sighed
once&mdash;not once&mdash;since they was married,
an' as for bein' happy&mdash;well&mdash;she says
she's about give up hope. She don't want
folks to know, 'cause she says she's got
some pride, but she says there's no tellin'
how soon it'll run out if Gran'ma Mullins
keeps on huggin' Hiram, an' tellin' her how
perfect he is over his own head."</p>

<p>"I don't&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Well, I should say not," said Susan;
"but Hiram Mullins always was his
mother's white goose, an' the whole town
is a witness. My idea if I was Lucy would
be to shut right down solid on the whole
thing. I'd put a bolt on my door an' keep
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>Gran'ma Mullins an' her tuckin' tendencies
on the other side, an' if Hiram Mullins
did n't come to time I'd bolt him out, too,
an' if he was n't nice about it I'd get out
of the window an' go home to my father.
I guess Mr. Dill would be very glad to have
Lucy home again, for they say 'Liza
Em'ly's no great success keepin' house for
him. Some one told me as Mr. Dill was in
mortal fear as he was practically feedin'
the minister's whole family every time she
went home, an' that would be enough to
make any man, as had only his own self
to feed, want his own daughter back, I
should think.</p>

<p>"There's Mrs. Macy as would be glad to
keep house for him if he 'd marry her first,
of course, but to my order of thinkin' Mr.
Dill don't want to marry Mrs. Macy near
as much as Mrs. Macy wants to marry Mr.
Dill. Mrs. Macy says he's pesterin' her to
death, an' Mr. Dill says if it's pesterin' to
speak when you're spoken to, he must buy
a new dictionary an' learn the new meanin'
of the words by heart. Between ourselves,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
I guess Mr. Dill is learnin' the lesson of
wedded bliss from lookin' at Lucy an' rememberin'
her mother. Lucy ain't very
happy an' you know as well as I do what
Mrs. Dill was. Her husband won't marry
again in a hurry, an' he's smart if he don't,
for if Lucy ain't home in less 'n a year I'll
make you a tea cake."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Well, you ain't Lucy Dill," said her
friend. "If you was you'd be different.
Lucy says this being waked up by havin'
a hot flatiron slid in among your feet most
any time for no better reason than 'cause
his mother thought she heard Hiram sneeze,
is a game as can be played once too often.
I see her temper was on the rise so I struck
in, an' give her a little advice of my own,
an' as a result she says she's goin' to take
a strong upper hand to 'em both an' there
won't be no velvet glove on it neither.
She says she can see as it's do or die for
her now, an' she don't mean to be done nor
to die neither. She drank some tea as I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
made strong on purpose, an' shook her
head hard an' went home, an' God help
Hiram if he hummed last night; an' as for
Gran'ma Mullins, Lucy said if she come
stealin' in to feel if Hiram was breathin'
reg'lar, she was going to get slapped for a
mosquito in a way as she'd long remember."</p>

<p>"Dear me&mdash;" commented Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Well, I did n't blame her," said Miss
Clegg. "Of course I did n't know as I
was going to hear the other side afore night
fell, but hearin' her side stirred me up so
that I give her my advice, an' my advice
was to put the bootjack under her pillow.
There ain't no sense in women sufferin'
any more, to my idea of thinkin'. It's a
good deal easier to go to bed with a bootjack,
an' I look to see Lucy really happy
or Hiram smashed flat soon in consequence."</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop, wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"I know, an' that did change my ideas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Of course when I was talkin' to Lucy I
was n't expectin' to see Gran'ma Mullins
so soon, but I won't say but what I was
glad to see Gran'ma Mullins, too. It's a
most curious feelin', I d'n know as I ever
feel a curiouser than to hear both sides
of anythin' from the both sides themselves
right one after the other in the same day.
O' course I learned long ago to never take
any sides myself unless one of 'em was
mine; but I will say as I don't believe no
one could feel for others more 'n I do
when I hear folks shakin' their heads over
what as a general thing a person with
brains like mine knows is their own fault,
an' knowed was goin' to be their own
fault afore they ever even began to think
of doin' it.</p>

<p>"Now there was Lucy Dill yesterday
forenoon mournin' 'cause Hiram is Hiram
an' his mother is his mother, an' then after
dinner there comes Gran'ma Mullins with
her bonnet strings an' her tears all streamin'
together, an' wants my sympathy 'cause<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Lucy herself is Lucy herself. Well, Mrs.
Lathrop, I can't but feel proud o' being
able to hold the reins so hard on my own
bit that I never up an' told either on 'em
the plain truth, which is as they was all
fools together to of ever looked for the weddin'
service to have changed any on 'em."</p>

<p>"What did&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"I don't know as I'm prepared to say
what I think. To hear Lucy you'd think
<i>she</i> was surely the martyr, but to hear
Gran'ma Mullins you would n't be sure
after all. Gran'ma Mullins says after the
honeymoon is over every one expects to
settle down as a matter of course, an' she
would n't say a word against it only it's
Lucy is doin' all the settlin' an' poor Hiram
as is doin' all the down. She says it's
heartbreakin' to be a only mother an'
watch the way as Hiram is being everlastin'ly
downed. She says as we all remember
that bright an' happy weddin'
day<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> an' how she downed her own feelin's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
an' waved rice after 'em just like everybody
else when they started off weddin'-trippin',
each with their own bag in his
own hand. But, oh, she says, the way
they come back! She says they come
back with Hiram carryin' both bags, an'
her heart sunk when she see 'em for she
says when she was married it was <i>her</i> as
come home carryin' both bags an' she says
it's one of the saddest straws as ever blows
a bride out. She says she never expected
much of her marriage 'cause she was engaged
on a April Fool's Day in Leap Year,
an' he give her an imitation opal for a
ring, but she says Hiram give Lucy a real
green emerald with a 18 an' a K inside it
an' he looked to be happy even with his
mother's tears mildewin' his pillow every
night that whole summer. She says no
one will ever know how hard she did try
to get sense into Hiram that summer afore
it was too late. She says she used to sit
up in tears an' wait for him to come home
from seein' Lucy, an' weep on his neck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
with her arms tight round him for two or
three hours afterwards every night, but
she says he never used to appreciate it.
An' she says what he needed to marry for,
anyway, Heaven only knows, with his
whole life laid pleasantly out to suit him,
an' a strong an' able-bodied mother ready
an' smilin' to hand him whatever he
wanted just as quick as he wanted it. An'
she says she never asked him to do nothin'
as she could possibly do herself an' the
way Lucy orders him about!&mdash;well, she
says it's beyond all belief. An' oh, but
she says it goes through her like a chained-up
bolt of lightnin' the voice Lucy speaks
to him in, an' she said she would n't have
no one know it for worlds but she says as
near as she can figger she hit him over the
head with a hairbrush night before last."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> See "Susan Clegg and her Neighbors' Affairs."</p></div>

<p>"With a&mdash;" cried Mrs. Lathrop, aghast.</p>

<p>"She says she ain't absolutely positive,
but they was a-chasin' a June bug in their
room together, an' she heard the smash an'
the next mornin' when she went in to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
make Hiram's side of the bed after Lucy
(she says Lucy is a most sing'lar bed-maker)
she see the nick on the brush, an'
she says when she see the nick an' remembered
how hollow it rung, she knew as it
could n't possibly have been nothin' in
that room except Hiram's head. She says
if Lucy's begun on Hiram with a hairbrush
now, Heaven only knows what she'll
be after him with in a year, for Gran'ma
Mullins' own husband went from a cake
of soap to a whole cheese in a fortnight
an' she says it's a well-known fact as when
a married man is once set a-goin' he lands
things faster an' faster. She says she
thinks about the andirons there, ready to
Lucy's hand, until she's scared white, an'
yet she's afraid to take 'em for fear it'd
attract her to the water pitcher."</p>

<p>"Did Mr.&mdash;" began Mrs. Lathrop, hurriedly,
after several attempts to slide a
question-quoit in among Susan's game of
words.</p>

<p>"Oh, he did n't throw 'em at her. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
could n't understand what he did do with
them an' so I asked, but it seems it was just
as awful for he grated the whole cake o'
that soap on her front teeth to teach her
not to never refer to the deacon again, an'
he dropped the cheese square on her head
when he was up on a step-ladder an' she
was in a little cupboard underneath leanin'
over for a plate, an' then he tried to make
out as it was an accident. She says it
was n't no accident though. She says a
woman as gets a cheese on the back of her
head from a husband as is on a step-ladder
over her, ain't to be fooled with no accident
story; she says that cheese like to of
hurt her for life an' was the greatest of the
consolations she had when he died. She
says she never will forget it as long as she's
alive an' he's dead, no sir, so help her
heaven she won't; she says when the cemetery
committee come to her an' want her
to subscribe for keepin' him trimmed with
a lawn mower an' a little flag on Decoration
Day, she always thinks of that cheese<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
an' says no, thank you, they can just mow
him regularly right along with the rest.</p>

<p>"But oh, she says it's awful bitter an'
cold to see Hiram settin' out along that
stony, bony, thorny road, as she's learned
every pin in from first to last. She says
if Lucy 'd only be a little patient with
him, but no, to bed he must go feelin' as
bright as a button, an' in the mornin', oh
my, but she says it's heartrendin' to hear
him wake up, for Lucy washes his face
so sudden with cold water that he gives
one howl before he remembers he's married,
an' five minutes after she hangs every
last one of the bedclothes square out of
the window.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Mrs. Lathrop, it was a
pretty sad tale first an' last, an' Gran'ma
Mullins says Hiram is as meek as a sheep
being led to its halter, but she says she
can't feel as meekness pays women much.
She says she was meek an' Hiram's meek,
an' she did n't get no reward but soap an'
that cheese, an' all Hiram's got so far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
is the hairbrush, an' the water pitcher
loomin'.</p>

<p>"I told her my own feelin's was as marriage
was n't enough took into consideration
nowadays, an' that it was too easy
at the start, an' too hard at the finish.
You know yourself, Mrs. Lathrop, as there
ain't a mite o' doubt but what if the
honeymoon come just afore the funeral
there'd be a deal more sincere mournin'
than there is as it is now, an' to <i>my</i> order
of thinkin', if the grandchildren come afore
the children, folks would raise their
families wiser. I told Gran'ma Mullins
just that very thing but it did n't seem to
give her much comfort. She give a little
yell an' said oh, Heaven preserve her from
havin' to sit by an' watch Lucy Dill raise
Hiram's children, for she was sure as she'd
never be able to give 'em enough pie on
the sly to keep 'em happy an' any one with
half an eye could see they'd be washed an'
brushed half to death. She says Lucy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>won't wash a dish without rinsin' it afterwards
or sweep a room without carryin'
all the furniture out into the yard; oh my,
she says her ways is most awful an' I expect
that, to Gran'ma Mullins, they are.</p>

<p>"I cheered her all I could. I told her
she'd better make the best o' things now,
'cause o' course as Lucy got older Hiram'd
make her madder an' madder, an'
they'll all soon be lookin' back to this
happy first year as their one glimpse of
paradise. I did n't tell her what Lucy
told me o' course, 'cause she'd go an' tell
Hiram, an' Hiram must love Lucy or he'd
never stand being hit for a June bug or
woke with a wash-cloth. But I did kind
of wonder how long it would last. If I
was Lucy it would n't last long, I know
<i>that</i>. If I'd ever married a man I don't
know how long he'd of stood it or how
long I'd of stood him, but I know one
thing, Mrs. Lathrop, an' I know that from
my heels to my hairpins&mdash;an' I said it to
Elijah last night, an' I'm goin' to say it
to you now&mdash;an' that is that if I could n't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
of stood him I would n't of stood him, for
this is the age when women as read the
papers don't stand nothin' they don't want
to&mdash;an' I would n't neither."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Well, you ain't me," said Miss Clegg,
"you ain't me an' you ain't Elijah neither.
I talk very kind to Elijah, but there's no
livin' in the house with any man as supposes
livin' in the house with any other
woman is goin' to be pleasanter than livin'
in the house with the woman as he's then
an' there livin' in the house with. The
main thing in life is to keep men down to
a low opinion of every woman's cookin' but
yours an' keep yourself down to a low
opinion of the man. You don't want to
marry him then an' he don't want to live
with any one else. An' to my order of
thinkin' that's about the only way that a
woman can take any comfort with a man
in the house."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">SUSAN CLEGG'S FULL DAY</p>


<p>"Well," said Miss Clegg, with strong
emphasis, as she mounted Mrs.
Lathrop's steps, "I don't know, I'm sure,
what I've come over here for this night,
for I never felt more like goin' right straight
off to bed in all my life before." Then she
sat down on the top step and sighed
heavily.</p>

<p>"It's been a full day," she went on
presently; "an' I can't deny as I was
nothin' but glad to remember as Elijah
was n't comin' home to supper, for as a
consequence I sha'n't have it to get. A
woman as has had a day like mine to-day
don't want no supper anyhow, an' it
stands to reason as if I don't feel lively
in the first place, I ain't goin' to be made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
any more so by comin' to see you, for I
will remark, Mrs. Lathrop, that seein' you
always makes me wonder more'n ever
why I come to see you so often when I
might just as well stay home an' go to bed.
If I was in my bed this blessed minute
I'd be very comfortable, which I'm very
far from bein' here with this mosquito aimin'
just over my slap each time; an' then,
too, I'd be alone, an' no matter how hard
I may try to make myself look upon bein'
with you as the same thing as bein' alone,
it is n't the same thing an' you can't in
conscience deny <i>that</i>, no matter how hard
you may sit without movin'."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lathrop made no reply to this frank
comment on her liveliness, and after a
short pause, Miss Clegg sighed heavily
a second time, and continued:</p>

<p>"It's been a full day, a awful full day.
In the first place the rooster was woke by
accident last night an' he up an' woke me.
He must of woke me about three o'clock
as near as I can figure it out now, but I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
supposed when I was woke as of course it
was five so I got right up an' went in an'
woke Elijah. Elijah told me last week as
he did n't believe he'd ever seen the sun
rise an' I was just enough out of sorts to
think as to-day would be a good time for
him to begin to turn over a new leaf as
far as the sunrise was concerned. I must
say he was n't very spry about the leaf, for
all he did was to turn himself over at first,
but I opened his window an' banged the
blinds three or four times an' in the end he
got woke up without really knowin' just
what had woke him. We had breakfast
with a candle, an' then Elijah was so tired
lookin' out for the sunrise that he looked
in at his watch an' see as it was only
quarter to four then. He was real put out
at that at first 'cause he wrote till half
past two last night, an' in the end he went
back to bed an' it certainly was a relief to
see the last of him, for I may in confidence
remark as I never see him look quite so
stupid afore. After he was gone back to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
bed I washed up the breakfast dishes an'
then I went out in the wood shed in the
dark an' there I got another surprise, for
I thought I'd look over the rags I was
savin' for the next rag rug an' when I
poured 'em out in my lap, what do you
think, Mrs. Lathrop, what <i>do</i> you think
poured out along with 'em?&mdash;Why, a
nest of young mice an' two old ones!</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop, you can maybe
imagine my feelin's at four in the mornin'
with Elijah gone back to bed an' my own
lap full of mice, but whatever I yelled
did n't disturb him any an' I just made
two jumps for the lamp in the kitchen,
leavin' the mice wherever they hit to rearrange
their family to suit themselves.
Well, the second jump must needs land me
right square on top of the cistern lid, an'
it up an' went in, takin' my left leg along
with it as far as it would go. Well, Mrs.
Lathrop, talk of girls as can open an' shut,
like scissors, in a circus&mdash;I was scissored
to that degree that for a little I could n't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
think which would be wisest, to try an'
get myself together again in the kitchen or
to just give up altogether in the cistern.
In the end I hauled the leg as had gone
in out again, an' then I see where all the
trouble come from, for the cistern lid was
caught to my garter an' what I'd thought
was a real injury was only it swingin'
around an' around my leg. I put the lid
back on the cistern an' felt to sit with my
legs crossed for quite a while, thinkin'
pleasant thoughts of the rooster as woke
me, an' by that time it was half past four,
an' I could hear all the other chickens stirrin'
so I got up an' began to stir again
myself. I opened the front door an' looked
out an' that did n't bring me no good luck
either, for as I looked out a bat flew in an'
just as the bat flew in he managed to hook
himself right in my hair. Well, Mrs. Lathrop,
I tell you I <i>was</i> mad then. I don't
know as I ever was madder than I was
then. I was so mad that I can't tell you
how mad I was. The bat held on by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
diggin' in like he thought I wanted to get
him off, an' I pulled at him so hard that
I can't in conscience be surprised much
over his takin' that view of it. Well, in
the end I had to take all my hairpins out
first an' then sort of skin him out of my
hair lengthways, which, whatever you may
think about it, Mrs. Lathrop, is far from
bein' funny along afore dawn on a day as
you 've begun at three thinkin' as it was
five."</p>

<p>"Susan!" ejaculated Mrs. Lathrop;
"don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I'll have some when I get home.
I like mine better than yours anyway.
Now you've made me forget where I was
in my story."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I remember now. Well, I
was too put out at first to notice what the
bat did after I got him out o' my head,
but when I went upstairs I found him
circlin' everywhere in a way as took every
bit of home feelin' out of the house an' I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
just saw that I'd have no peace till I could
be alone with Elijah again. So I got up
an' got a broom an' went a battin' for all
I was worth. Well, Mrs. Lathrop, you can
believe me or not just as you please, but
for one solid hour I run freely an' gayly up
an' down an' over an' under my own house
after that bat. I never see nothin' like
that bat before or behind. He just sort
of sailed here an' there an' everywhere, an'
wherever he sailed smoothly an' easily
there was me runnin' after him with the
broom, whackin' at him every chance I
got. We was upstairs, we was downstairs,
we was in the wood shed an' out of the
wood shed, we was under the kitchen table,
we was over father's picture on the mantel&mdash;we
was everywhere, me an' that bat.
Then all of a sudden he disappeared completely
an' I sit down in the rockin'-chair
to puff an' rest. Elijah slept till most
eight an' I was so tired I let him sleep
although I never was one to approve of
any man's sleepin', but before he woke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
something worse than a bat come down
on me, an' that was Mrs. Sweet's cousin,
Jerusha Dodd. You know Jerusha Dodd,
Mrs. Lathrop, an' so do I, an' so does
everybody an' as far as my observation 's
extended bats is wise men bringin' their
gifts from afar to visit you compared to
Jerusha Dodd when she arrives in the
early mornin'. I would n't never have
gone to the door only she stepped up on the
drain-pipe first an' looked in an' saw me
there in the rockin'-chair afore she knocked.
I tell you I was good an' mad when I see
her an' see as she see me an' I made no
bones of it when I opened the door. I
says to her frank an' open&mdash;I says,
'Good gracious, Jerusha, I hope you ain't
lookin' to see me pleased at seein' as it's
you.' But laws, you could n't smash
Jerusha Dodd not if you was a elephant
an' she was his sat-down-upon fly, so I had
her sittin' in the kitchen an' sighin' in
less'n no time. She was full of her woes
an' the country's woes as usual. Congress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
was goin' to ruin us next year sure, an' she
had a hole in her back fence anyway; she
did n't approve of Mr. Rockefeller's prices
on oil, an' there was a skunk in her cellar,
an' she said she could n't seem to learn to
enjoy livin' the simple life as she'd had
to live it since her father died, a <i>tall</i>. She
said that accordin' to her views life for
single women nowadays was too simple an'
she said she really only lacked bein' buried
to be dead. She says as all a simple life
is, is havin' no rights except them as your
neighbors don't want. She says for her
part she's been more took into the heart
of creation than she's ever cared about. I
do hate to have to listen to the way she
goes on an' no one can say as I ever was
one to encourage her in them views. I
don't think it's right to encourage no one
in their own views 'cause their views is
never mine an' mine is always the right
ones. This mornin' I stood it as long as
I could from Jerusha an' then I just let
out at her an' I says to her, I says,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
'Jerusha Dodd, you really are a fool an'
Heaven help them as ever makes more of
a fool of you, by tellin' you as you ain't.'
You know Jerusha Dodd, Mrs. Lathrop;
she began to cry hard an' rock harder right
off, said she knowed she was a fool, but it
was nature's fault an' not hers for she was
born so an' could n't seem to get the
better of it. I told her my view of the
matter would be for her to stay home an'
patch up that hole in her fence an' pull
up some o' that choice garden full of weeds
as she's growin', an' brush the dust off
the crown of her bonnet, an' do a few other
of them wholesome little trifles as is a good
deal nearer the most of us than Mr. Rockefeller
an' what congress in its infinite wisdom
is goin' to see fit to deal out in the
daily papers next year.</p>

<p>"But she only kept on cryin' an' rockin'
an' finally I got so tired listenin' to her
creak an' sob that I went out an' had a
real bright idea. I got the little sink
scratcher an' tied a wet piece of rag to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
handle an' went around behind her an' hung
it suddenly in her back hair. She put up
her hand an' felt it, an' give a yell that
woke Elijah. You know how Jerusha
Dodd acts when she's upset! She spun
around so the sink scratcher fell right out
but she did n't have sense enough left in
her to know it. She yelled, 'What was it?
what was it?' an' I yelled, 'It was a bat,
it was a bat;' an' at that I see the last of
Jerusha Dodd, for she was out of my
kitchen an' out of my sight afore Elijah
could get to the top of the stairs to begin
yellin', 'What was it? what was it?' on his
own hook. I had to tell him all about it
then an' he wanted it for a item right off.
He said he'd have a dash for Jerusha an'
a star for me, an' the idea took him like
most of his ideas do, an' he laughed till he
coughed the coffee as I'd saved for him
all the wrong way, an' dropped a soft
boiled egg as I'd boiled for him into the
water pitcher, an', oh my, I thought misfortunes
never would come to a end or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
even to a turnin'. But after he'd fished
out the egg an' eat it, he went off down
to his uncle's an' he was n't more'n gone
when in come Mrs. Sweet to see if Jerusha
left her breastpin, 'cause in her quick
breathin' it had fallen somewhere an'
Jerusha was havin' hysterics over losin'
that now. While I was talkin' to Mrs.
Sweet at the gate I smelt somethin' burnin'
an' there my whole bakin' of bread was
burnt up in the oven owin' to Jerusha
Dodd's breathin' her breastpin out over a
bat. I felt to be some tempered then, an'
Mrs. Sweet saw it an' turned around an'
left me, an' after she was gone I went into
the house an' pulled down the shades an'
locked the door an' went to sleep. I slept
till Elijah come home to dinner an' of
course there was n't no dinner ready an'
that put Elijah out. Elijah's got a good
deal of a temper, I find, an' the only thing
in the world to do with a man in a temper,
when he is in a temper, is to make him so
mad that he goes right off in a huff an'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
leaves you to peace again. So I just made
one or two remarks about my opinion of
things as he feels very strong about, an'
he said he guessed he'd get supper down
town an' sleep at the store to-night. So
he took himself off an' he was hardly out
of the way when Mrs. Macy come to tell
me about Judy Lupey's divorce."</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;" cried Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Not yet, but she soon will be," said
Miss Clegg. "Mrs. Macy's just back from
Meadville an' she says all Meadville is
churned up over it. They ain't never had
a divorce there afore, an' every one is so
interested to know just how to do it, an'
I will say this much for Mrs. Macy, an'
that is that she was nothin' but glad to
tell me all about it. Seems as the Lupeys
is most awful upset over it though an'
Mrs. Kitts says she ain't sure as she won't
change her will sooner than leave money
to a woman with two husbands."</p>

<p>"Two&mdash;" cried Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Macy says," continued Susan,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
"as Mrs. Lupey ain't much better pleased
than Mrs. Kitts over it all, an', although
she did n't say it in so many words, she
hinted pretty plain as it seemed hard as
the only one of the girls to get married
should be the same one as is gettin'
divorced. Mrs. Macy said she see her
point of view, but to her order of thinkin'
the world don't begin to be where old
maids need consider divorces yet awhile.
She says she stayed in the house with 'em
all three days an' she says she cheered
Mrs. Lupey all she could; she says she told
her to her best ear as no one but a mother
would ever have dreamed of dreamin' of
Faith or Maria's ever marryin' under any
circumstances. She said Mrs. Lupey said
it was the quickness of Judy's gettin' tired
of Mr. Drake as had frightened her most.
Why, she says as before the first baby was
through teethin' in her day, Judy was all up
an' through an' completely done with Mr.
Drake. All done with him an' home again,
an' the family not even countin' to consider.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mrs. Macy says as she's learned a
awful lot about divorce as she did n't know
before. She said she could n't help being
surprised over how much a divorce is like
a marriage, for Busby Bell was there every
night an' Judy an' the whole family is hard
at work gettin' her clothes ready. But
Mrs. Macy says them as suppose the real
gettin' of the divorce itself is simple had
ought to go an' stay at the Lupeys awhile.
Why, she says the way the Lupeys is complicated
an' tied up by Judy an' Mr. Drake
is somethin' beyond all belief. To begin
with, Judy decided to be deserted because
she thought it'd really be the simplest an'
easiest in the end an' she hated to bother
with bein' black an' blue for witnesses an'
all that kind of business. But it seems
being deserted, when you live in the same
town with a husband who rides a bicycle
an' don't care where he meets you, is just
enough to drive a woman nigh to madness
itself. Why, Mrs. Macy says that Judy
Lupey actually can't go out to walk a <i>tall</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
not 'nless Faith walk a block ahead of
her an' Maria a block behind, an' even then
Mr. Drake's liable to come coastin' down
on 'em any minute. She says it's awful
tryin', an' Judy gets so mad over it all that
it just seems as if they could <i>not</i> stand it.</p>

<p>"But that ain't the only trouble neither,
Mrs. Macy says. Seems Judy got Solomon
Drake for her lawyer 'cause he knowed the
whole story, through eatin' dinner at the
Drakes every Sunday while they was stayin'
married. She thought havin' Solomon
Drake would save such a lot of explainin'
'cause Mr. Drake is so hard to explain to
any one as has just seen him ridin' his bicycle
an' not really been his wife. Well, seems
as Judy never calculated on Solomon's
keepin' right on takin' Sunday dinner with
Mr. Drake, after he became her lawyer, but
he does, an' none of the Lupeys think it
looks well, an' Judy finds it most tryin'
because all she an' Solomon talk over about
the divorce he tells Mr. Drake on Sunday
out of gratitude for his dinner an' because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
it's a subject as seems to really interest
Mr. Drake. Seems Mr. Drake is a hard
man to interest. Judy says he was yawnin'
afore they got to the station on their
honeymoon.</p>

<p>"But Mrs. Macy says that ain't all,
neither, whatever you may think, for she
says what do you think of Mr. Drake's
goin' an' gettin' Busby Bell of all the men
in Meadville for <i>his</i> lawyer, when the whole
town knows as it's Busby as Judy's goin'
to marry next. Mrs. Lupey says as Judy
would have took Busby for her own lawyer
only they was so afraid of hurtin' each
other's reputations, an' now really it's terrible,
'cause Busby says as he don't well
see what's to be done about their reputations
if the worst comes to the worst, for
he's explained as very likely Judy's goin'
to need one more man than a husband to
get her her divorce. Mrs. Macy says Mrs.
Lupey says as Busby said as if he had n't
been Mr. Drake's lawyer he'd have been
more than ready to be the other man, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
as Mr. Drake's lawyer he can't help Judy
no more'n if he was Mr. Drake himself.
Mrs. Macy says Mrs. Lupey cried, an' she
told her as she knowed as there was any
number of quiet elderly men as any one
could depend on right here in our own
community as'd be nothin' but glad to go
over to Meadville an' help anyway they
could, but Mrs. Lupey asked Judy about
it, an' Judy asked Busby, an' Busby said
men as you could depend on anywhere
was n't no use in divorce suits a <i>tall</i>. It's
quite another kind, it seems. Mrs. Macy
says she's really very sorry for them all,
for it really seems awful to think how the
Lupeys need a man an' the only man
they've got Judy's busy gettin' rid of as
hard as she can.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Macy says it's all most upsettin'.
She says she never lived through nothin'
like it afore. Judy's cross 'cause she can't
go out an' meet Busby without runnin' the
risk of meetin' Mr. Drake an' losin' all the
time she's put in so far bein' deserted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
An' then there's a many things as a outsider
never would know about or even
guess at unless they've lived right in the
house with a real live divorce. Mrs. Macy
says as Martha Hack, as does the washin'
for 'em all, is forever forgettin' an' sendin'
Judy's wash home with Mr. Drake's just
as if they was still completely married.
That would n't be so bad only Mr. Drake
waits for Solomon to get 'em Sunday, an'
Solomon's kind-hearted an' gives 'em to
Busby so as to give him a excuse to make
two calls in one day. Well, Mrs. Macy
says the come out of it all is as when Judy
wants to take a bath just about all Meadville
has to turn out to see where under
heaven her clean clothes is.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Mrs. Lathrop, tellin' it all
to you does n't matter so much, but to
hear Mrs. Macy tell it makes you wonder
if it's worth while to try an' leave a man
as you can't live with. Seems to me
it'd be easier to live with him. Mrs. Macy
says as she met Mr. Drake several times<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
herself on his bicycle an' he looked most
bloomin'. No one need be sorry for him,
an' not many is sorry for Judy. But Mrs.
Macy says there's only one person as all
Meadville's sorry for, an' that's Busby Bell."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lathrop started to speak.</p>

<p>"Yes," Susan went on hurriedly. "Elijah
said just that same thing the other
day when he was talkin' about the Marlboroughs.
He thinks as divorces is all a
mistake, but then you're a widow an'
Elijah ain't married so you're both pretty
safe in airin' your views."</p>

<p>Susan rose just here and descended the
steps. "I must go," she said, "I don't
seem to take no particular interest in what
you might be goin' to tell me, Mrs. Lathrop,
even if there was any chance of your
ever gettin' around to tellin' it, an' I've
told you all I know, an' I'm very tired
talkin'. As I said before, it's been a full
day an' I'm pretty well beat out. I forgot
to tell you as after Mrs. Macy was gone
I found as it was n't the bread I smelt in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the oven&mdash;it was the bat. I suppose
when I see Mr. Kimball he'll make one of
his jokes over bread-dough an' bats an'
batter, but I'll be too wore out to care.
Did I say as Elijah said he'd sleep at the
store to-night?"</p>

<p>"Will&mdash;" cried Mrs. Lathrop, all of a
sudden.</p>

<p>"Why, of course," said Susan, "it did n't
hurt either loaf a mite. I'd be as much
of a fool as Jerusha Dodd if I let a little
thing like a bat spoil a whole bakin' of
bread for me, Mrs. Lathrop. As for Elijah,
he did n't know nothin' about it an'
I sha'n't tell him, you may be sure, for he's
the one as eats all the bread&mdash;I never
touch it myself, as you well know."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="center">THE EDITOR'S ADVICE COLUMN</p>


<p>"I'm a good deal worried over Elijah,"
Miss Clegg said to Mrs. Lathrop, one
day when the new paper was about three
weeks old, and when the town had begun
to take both it and its editor with reasonable
calm; "he does have so many ideas.
Some of his ideas are all right as far as I
can see, but he has 'em so thick an' fast
that it worries me more'n a little. It
ain't natural to have new ideas all the time
an' no one in this community ever does it.
He's forever tellin' me of some new way
he's thought of for branchin' out somewhere
an' his branches make me more'n
a little nervous. The old ways is good
enough for us an' I try to hold him down
to that idea, but first he wants me to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
a new kind of flatirons as takes off while
you heat it, an' next he wants me to fix
the paper all over new.</p>

<p>"I brought over somethin' as he wrote
last night to read you, an' show you how
curious his brains do mix up things. He
brought it down this mornin' an' read it
to me, an' I asked him to give it to me to
read to you. I was goin' to bring it to
you anyway, but then he said as I could
too, so it's all right either way. It's some
of his new ideas an' he said he'd be nothin'
but glad to have you hear 'em 'cause
he says the more he lives with me the
more respect he's got for your hearin'
an' judgment. He asked me what I
thought of it first, an' I told him
frank an' open as I did n't know what
under the sun to think of it. I meant
that, too, for I certainly never heard
nothin' like it in my life afore, so he
said we could both read it to-day an' I
could tell him what we thought to-night,
when he come home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wh&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop, with real
interest.</p>

<p>"Well, seems he's been thinkin' as it's
time to begin to show us how up-to-date
he looks on life, he says, an' as a consequence
he's openin' up what he calls the
field of the future. He says he's goin' to
have a editorial this week on beginnin'
from now on to make every issue of the
<i>Megaphone</i> just twice as good as the one
afore. I told him if he really meant what
he said it could n't possibly be worth no
dollar a year now, but he said wait an' see
an' time would tell an' virtue be her own
reward. He says he's goin' to make arrangements
with a woman in the city for
a beauty column, an' arrangements with
some other woman as is a practical preserver,
an' have a piece each time on how
to be your own dressmaker once you get
cut out; I thought that these things was
about enough for one paper, but oh my! he
went on with a string more, as long as
your arm. He's goin' to begin to have a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
advice column too, right off, an' that's this
I've brought over to read you; he says
lots of folks want advice an' don't want
to tell no one nor pay nothin' an' they can
all write him an' get their answers on anythin'
in the wide world when the paper
comes out Saturday. I could n't but open
my eyes a little at that, for I know a many
as need advice as I should n't consider
Elijah knew enough to give, but Elijah's
a man an' in consequence don't know anythin'
about how little he does know, so I
did n't say nothin' more on that subject.
He's full of hope an' says he's soon goin'
to show big city papers what genius can
do single-handed with a second-hand
printin' press, an' he talked an' talked till
I really had to tell him that if he did n't
want his breakfast he'd have to go back
to bed or else down town."</p>

<p>"Is the&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Yes, this is it. He done it last night
an' he give it to me this mornin' to read to
you. It's to be called 'The Advice Column'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
an' he's goin' to head it 'Come to My
Bosom' an' sign it 'Aunt Abby' 'cause of
course if he signed it himself he'd be liable
for breach of promise from any girl as read
the headin' an' chose to think he meant
her."</p>

<p>"But who&mdash;?" began Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Why, nobody the first week, of course.
He had to make 'em up himself&mdash;an' the
answers too, an' that's what makes it all
seem so silly to me. But he did work
over it,&mdash;he says no one knows the work
of gettin' people stirred up to enthusiasm
in a small town like this, an' he says he'd
ought to have a martyr's crown of thorns,
he thinks, for even thinkin' of gettin' a
advice column started when most of his
energies is still got to go tryin' to get our
fund for the famine big enough to make it
pay to register the letter when the cheque
goes. He says the trouble with the fund
is no one has no relations there an' a good
many thought as it was mostly Chinamen
as is starvin' anyhow. Elijah says the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
world is most dreadful hard-hearted about
Chinamen&mdash;they don't seem to consider
them as of any use a <i>tall</i>. He says it's
mighty hard to get up a interest in anythin'
here anyhow, Lord knows&mdash;for he
says that San Francisco fund an' what
become of it has certainly been a pill an'
no mistake. The nearest he come to that
was gettin' a letter as Ph&oelig;be White wrote
the deacon about how the government
relief train run right through the town
she's in, but Elijah says after all his efforts
he has n't swelled the famine fund thirty-five
cents this week. He says Clightville
has give nine dollars an' Meadville has
give fifteen dollars an' two barrels an' a
mattress, if anybody wants it C. O. D., an'
here we are stuck hard at six dollars an' a
quarter an' two pennies as the minister's
twins brought just after they choked on
them licorish marbles."</p>

<p>"Did&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"No, I did n't. I tell you what, Mrs.
Lathrop, I keep a learnin'; in regard to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
givin' to funds I've learned a very good
trick from Rockefeller an' Carnegie in the
papers; they come to me about that San
Francisco one an' I said right out frank an'
open that if the town would give five hundred
dollars I'd give fifty. That shut up
every one's mouth an' set every one to
thinkin' how much I was willin' to give an'
as a matter of fact I did n't give nothin' a
<i>tall</i>."</p>

<p>"But about&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Susan, opening the paper
which she had in her hand, "I was just
thinkin' of it, too. I'll read it to you
right off now an' you see if you don't think
about as I do. I think myself as Elijah's
made some pretty close cuts at people, only
of course every one will guess as he must
of made 'em up 'cause they don't really
fit to no one. Still, it's a risky business an'
I wish he'd let it alone for he lives in my
house an' I know lots of folks as is mean
enough to say that these things was like
enough said to him by me&mdash;a view as is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
far from likely to make my friends any
more friendly."</p>

<p>"Do&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm goin' to." Then Miss Clegg
drew a long breath and re-began thus:</p>

<p>"Well, now, the first is, 'How can you
put pickles up so they'll keep the year
'round?'" She paused there and looked
expectantly at the placid Mrs. Lathrop
as if she was asking a riddle or conducting
an examination for the benefit of her
friend. Mrs. Lathrop, however, had turned
and was looking the other way so it was
only when the length of the pause brought
her to herself with a violent start, that she
answered:</p>

<p>"My heavens ali&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The answer is," said Susan promptly,
"'Put 'em up so high that nobody can
reach them.'"</p>

<p>Mrs. Lathrop opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"I don't&mdash;" she protested.</p>

<p>"No, I did n't think as it was very
sensible myself," responded Susan, "but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
do you know, Elijah laughed out loud over
it. That's what's funny about Elijah to
my order of thinkin'&mdash;he's so amused at
himself. He thinks that's one of the best
things he's done as a editor, he says, an'
I'm sure I can't see nothin' funny in it
any more than you can. An' you don't see
nothin' funny in it, do you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Lathrop, "I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nor me neither," said Susan, "an' now
the next one is sillier yet, to my order of
thinkin'. It's a letter an' begins, 'Dear
Aunt Abby;' then it says, 'Do you think
it is possible to be happy with a young
man with freckles? My husband says Yes,
but my mother says No. He's my husband's
son by his first wife. I have twins
myself. I want the boy sent to a home
of some sort. What do you think? Yours
affectionately&mdash;Ada.'"</p>

<p>"What under the&mdash;" ejaculated Mrs.
Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Just what I said," said Susan. "I
could n't make head or tail out of it myself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
an' I'm afraid it'll make Deacon White
mad 'cause Polly's his second wife&mdash;yes,
an' the minister's got two wives, too. I
tried to make Elijah see that but he just
said to read the answer."</p>

<p>"What is&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Oh, the answer's just as dumbfounderin'
as the question, I think. The answer
says, 'Hang on to the boy. If you get
the twin habit he'll prove invaluable.'"</p>

<p>"Well, I&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop, disgustedly.</p>

<p>"I told Elijah that myself. I said that
the minister was bound to feel hurt over
the second wife part, but with twins in
the answer he's sure to feel it means him
an' I expect he'll maybe stop takin' the
paper an' join Mrs. Macy's club. Mrs.
Macy got real mad at somethin' Mr. Kimball
sold her last week an' as a consequence
she went an' made what she calls her
Newspaper Club, she rents her paper for
a cent a day now an' she made four cents
last week. She says if Elijah Doxey ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
says anythin' in the paper about her again
she'll take three papers an' rent 'em at
two mills a day an' supply the whole town
an' wreck him so flat he'll have to hire
out to pick hops. I told Elijah what she
said an' he said for the Lord's sake to tell
Mrs. Macy as her toes was hereafter perfectly
safe from all his treads. I told her,
but she says he need n't think quotin'
from poets is goin' to inspire faith in him
in her very soon again. She says over in
Meadville it's town talk as Elijah Doxey is
havin' just a box of monkeys' fun with us."</p>

<p>"Do you&mdash;" cried Mrs. Lathrop, open-eyed.</p>

<p>"No, I don't, for I asked him an' he
crossed his heart to the contrary. But
really, Mrs. Lathrop, you must let me read
the rest of this for I've got to be gettin'
home to get supper."</p>

<p>"Go&mdash;" said the neighbor.</p>

<p>"No, I won't till I've done. The next
one is this one an' it says, 'How long ought
any one to wait to get married? I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
waited several years an' there is nothin'
against the man except he's eighty-two
an' paralyzed. I am seventy-nine. Pa an'
Ma oppose the match an' are the oldest
couple in the country,' an' Elijah has
signed it 'Lovin'ly, Rosy'&mdash;of all the
silly things!"</p>

<p>"He must be&mdash;" cried Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"I should think so," said Susan; "why,
he was rollin' all over the sofa laughin'
over that. The answer is, 'I would wait
a little longer&mdash;you can lose nothin' by
patience.' I call that pretty silly, too."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said Susan, folding up the
paper, "I felt it an' I said it, an' I knew
you'd feel to agree. I like Elijah, but I
must say as I don't like his Advice
Column, an' I'd never be one to advise
no one to write to it for advice. His answers
don't seem to tell you nothin', to
my order of thinkin', an' that one about
the pickles struck me just like a slap in
my face."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd never&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Nor me neither. If I want to know I
come to you."</p>

<p>"And I&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop warmly.</p>

<p>"I know you would," said her friend,
"whatever faults you've got, Mrs. Lathrop,
I'd always feel that about you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="center">MRS. MACY AND THE CONVENTION</p>


<p>Mrs. Lathrop was out in the garden,
pottering around in an aimless
sort of way which she herself designated
as "looking after things," but which her
friend and neighbor called "wastin' time
an' strength on nothin'." Whenever Miss
Clegg perceived Mrs. Lathrop thus engaged
she always interrupted her occupation as
speedily as possible. On the occasion of
which I write, she emerged from her own
kitchen door at once, and called:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Lathrop, come here, I've got
a surprise for you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lathrop forthwith ceased to gaze
fondly and absent-mindedly over her half-acre
of domain, and advanced to the fence.
Miss Clegg also advanced to the fence, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
upon its opposite sides the following conversation
took place.</p>

<p>"I went to see Mrs. Macy yesterday
afternoon," Miss Clegg began, "an' I saw
her an' that's what the surprise come
from."</p>

<p>"She isn't&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, she's all right&mdash;that is, she's
pretty nearly all right, but I may remark
as the sight an' hearin' of her this day is
a everlastin' lesson on lettin' women be
women an' allowin' men to keep on bein'
men for some years to come yet. Mrs.
Macy says for her part she's felt that way
all along but every one said it was her duty
an' she says she always makes a point of
doin' her duty, an' this time it was goin'
to give her a free trip to town, too, so the
hand of Providence seemed to her to be
even more'n unusually plainly stuck out
at her."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Mrs. Lathrop&mdash;"you
mean&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course I do," said Susan, "but wait
till I tell you how it come out. It's come
out now, an' all different from how you
know."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Well, you wait an' listen," said the
friend,&mdash;"you wait an' listen an' then
you'll know, too."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop, submissively.</p>

<p>"She says," Miss Clegg went on, "that
we all know (an' that's true, too, 'cause I
told you that before) as she was never
much took with the idea even in the first
of it. She says as she thinks as Elijah's
ideas is gettin' most too progressive an'
if he ain't checked we'll very soon find
ourselves bein' run over by some of his
ideas instead of pushed forward. She says
woman's clubs is very nice things an' Mrs.
Lupey takes a deal of pleasure with the
one in Meadville (whenever they don't
meet at her house)&mdash;but Mrs. Macy says
our sewin' society ain't no club an' never
was no club, an' she considers as it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
overdrawin' on Elijah's part to start the
question of its sendin' a delegate to any
federation of any kind of woman's clubs.
She says she can't see&mdash;an' she said at
the meetin' as elected her, that she
couldn't see&mdash;what our sewin' society
could possibly get out of any convention,
for you can buy all the patterns by mail
now just as well as if you have 'em all to
look over. An' then she says, too, as no
one on the face of kingdom come could
ever be crazy enough to suppose as any
convention could ever get anythin' out of
our delegates, so what was the use of us
an' them ever tryin' to get together a <i>tall</i>.
I thought she was very sensible yesterday,
an' I thought she was very sensible at the
meetin' as elected her, an' I tried to talk
to Elijah, but Elijah's so dead set on our
bein' up to time with every Tom, Dick an'
Harry as comes along with any kind of a
new plan, that I can't seem to get him to
understand as no one in this town wants
to be up to time&mdash;we're a great deal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
better suited takin' our own time like we
always did until he come among us. Mrs.
Macy says as we all know as no one
wanted to be a delegate to the federation
to begin with, an' you know that yourself,
Mrs. Lathrop, for I was there an' Elijah's
idea resulted in the first place in every
one's stayin' away from that meetin' for
fear as they'd be asked to go. They had
to set another day for the sewin' society
an' even then a good many cleaned house
instead for a excuse, an' Mrs. Sweet said
right out as she did n't believe as any of
us knowed enough to go to a convention
an' so we'd better all stay home. I had
to speak up at that an' say as Elijah had
told me as things was fixed now so folks
as did n't know anythin' could go to a
convention just as well as any one else, but
Mrs. Jilkins said in that case she should
feel as if she was wastin' her time along
with a lot of fools, an' what she said made
such a impression that in the end the only
one as they could possibly get to go was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Mrs. Macy, so they elected her. Mrs. Macy
was n't enthusiastic about bein' elected, a
<i>tall</i>, but Mrs. Lupey is her cousin an' Mrs.
Lupey was the Meadville delegate, an' she
says she thought as they could sit together,
an' Mrs. Lupey wanted to go to the city
anyway about reducin' her flesh, an' Mrs.
Macy said that was sure to be interestin'
for the one as Mrs. Lupey likes best is the
one as you run chains of marbles up an'
down your back alone by yourself, an'
Mrs. Macy wanted to see them givin' Mrs.
Lupey full directions for nothin'&mdash;she
thought it would be so amusin'&mdash;an' so in
the end she said she'd go.</p>

<p>"Well, she says foreign folks before they
come to this country is wise compared to
her! She was tellin' me all about it this
afternoon. I never hear such a tale&mdash;not
even from Gran'ma Mullins. She says
Elijah sent in her name an' they filed her
next day an' she says they've never quit
sendin' her the filin's ever since. I told
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>you as I heard in the square she was gettin'
a good deal of mail but I never mistrusted
how much until she showed me
her box for kindlin' fires next winter.
Why, she says it's beyond all belief! The
right end of the box has got the papers as
was n't worth nothin' an' the left end has
got them as is really valuable. Well, after
I'd looked at the box we set down an' she
told me the hide an' hair of the whole
thing. She says at first she got letters
from everybody under the sun askin' her
her opinions an' views, some about things
as she never heard of before an' others as
to things as she considers a downright
insult to consider as she might know about.
But she says views an' insults don't really
matter much, after you reach her age, so
she let those all go into the box together
an' thought she'd think no more about it.
She says there was only just one as she
really minded an' that was the one about
her switch. Seems she was n't decided
about even wearin' her switch to the convention,
for she says it's very hard to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
both ends of a switch fastened in at the
same do-up an' one end looks about as
funny as the other, stickin' out, but she
says you can maybe imagine her feelin's
when a man as she would n't know from
Adam wrote her a letter beginnin', 'Hello,
hello, why don't you have that dyed?' an'
a picture of him lookin' at a picture of her
very own switch with a microscope! She
says she never was so took aback in all her
life. There was another picture on the
envelope of the man at a telephone an'
he'd got all the other delegates' switches
done an' hangin' up to dry for 'em an' she
says she will say as the law against sendin'
such things through the mail had certainly
ought to be applied to that man
right then an' there. She says it's years
since she's got red from anythin' but bein'
mad, but she was red from both kinds of
woman's feelin's then an' don't you forget
it. But laws, she says switches is child's
play to what another man wrote her about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>his garters. Not her garters but his garters,
mind you, Mrs. Lathrop. Would you
believe that that other man had the face
to ask her point-blank if, while she was in
town, she'd be so kind as to give five
minutes to comin' an' lookin' at his garters!&mdash;at
<i>his garters</i>! He said they
hooked onto his shoulders an' he just
wanted a chance to tell her how comfortable
they was. Well, she says the idea
of any man's garters bein' of any interest
to a widow was surely most new to her,
an' it was all she could do to keep from
writin' an' tellin' him so. She says she
never hear the beat of such impertinence
in all her life. Why, she says when she
had a husband she never took no special
interest in his garters as she recollects.
She says she remembers as he used to pull
up when he first got up in the mornin' an'
then calmly wrinkle down all day, but
she says if her lawful husband's garters'
wrinkles did n't interest her, it ain't in
reason as any other man's not wrinklin' is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>goin' to. But she says that ain't all whatever
I may think (or you either, Mrs. Lathrop),
for although the rest ain't maybe so
bad, still it's bad enough an' you 'll both
agree to that when you hear it, I know.
She says more men wrote her, an' more,
an' more, an' the things they said was
about all she could stand, so help her
Heaven! One asked her if she knowed she
needed a new carpet an' he happened to
keep carpets, an' another told her her
house needed paintin' an' he happened to
keep paint, an' another just come out flat
as a flounder an' said if she knowed how
old her stove was, she'd come straight to
him the first thing, an' he happened to
keep stoves. An' she says they need n't
suppose as she was n't sharp enough to see
as every last one of them letters was really
writ to sound unselfish, but with the meanin'
underneath of maybe gettin' her to
buy somethin'.</p>

<p>"An' then she says there come a new
kind as really frightened her by gettin'
most too intimate on postal cards."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"On postal&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;on postal cards. One wrote as
she could get her husband back if she'd
only follow his direction, an' she says the
last thing she wants is to get her husband
back, even if he is only just simply dead;
an' another told her if she'd go through
his exercises she could get fat or thin just
as she pleased, an' the exercises was done
in black without no clothes on around the
edge of the card, an' Mrs. Macy says when
Johnny handed her the card at the post
office she like to of died then an' there.
Why, she says they was too bad to put in
a book, even&mdash;they was too bad to even
send Mrs. Lupey!"</p>

<p>"Wh&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Then on Monday last still another new
kind begin an' they've been comin' more
an' more each mail. They was the convention
itself beginnin' on her. An' she
says she don't know whether they was a
improvement or worse to come. One wrote
an' told her if she was temperance to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
report to them the first thing, an' then
stand shoulder to shoulder from then on
straight through the whole week. Well,
Mrs. Macy says she could n't consider goin'
anywhere an' standin' up through a whole
week so she wrote 'em she was for the
Family Entrance, where everybody can sit
down, an' she feels bad because she's a
great believer in temperance, but she says
she can't help it, she's got to have a chair
anywhere where she's to stay for a week.
So temperance loses Mrs. Macy. Then
woman's sufferige did n't wait to ask her
what she was, but sent her a button an'
told her to sew it right on right then an'
there. She says she was feelin' so bad
over the temperance that she was only too
glad to be agreeable about the button so
she done it, but it's hard to button over
on a'count of bein' a star with the usual
spikes an' the only place where she needed
a button was on her placket hole, an' a
spiked button in the back of your petticoat
is far from bein' amusin' although she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
says she can't but think as it's a very good
badge for sufferige whenever she steps on
it in steppin' out of her clothes at night.
Then next she got a letter askin' her if
she'd join the grand battalion to rally
around the flag, an' she says it was right
then an' there as she begin to fill the
kindlin' box.</p>

<p>"Well, she says she'd got the box half
full when to-day she got the final slam in
her face!</p>

<p>"There came this mornin' her directions
for goin' an' she says when she see for the
first time just the whole width of what she
was let in to she most fell over backward
then an' there.</p>

<p>"First was a badge with a very good
safety pin as she can always use; she says
she did n't mind the badge. Then there
was paper tellin' her as she was M. 1206
an' not to let it slip her mind an' to mark
everythin' she owned with it an' sew it in
her hat an' umbrella. Then there was a
map of the city with blue lines an' pink<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
squares an' a sun without any sense shinin'
square in the middle. Then there was a
paper as she must fill out an' return by the
next mail if she was meanin' to eat or sleep
durin' the week. Then there was four
labels all to be writ with her name an' her
number an' one was for her trunk if it
weighed over a hundred pounds, an' one
was for her trunk if it weighed under a
hundred pounds, an' one was for her trunk
if it was a suit case, an' one was for her
trunk if it was n't.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Macy says you can maybe
imagine how her head was swimmin' by
this time an' the more she read how she
was to be looked out for, the more scared
she got over what might possibly happen
to her. She says it was just shock after
shock. There was a letter offerin' to pray
with her any time she'd telephone first,
an' a letter tellin' her not to overpay the
hack, an' a letter sayin' as it's always darkest
afore dawn, an' if she'd got any money
saved up to bring it along with her an'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
invest it by the careful advice of him as
had the letter printed at his own expense.
Why, she says she didn't know which way
to turn or what to do next she was that
mixed up.</p>

<p>"An' then yesterday mornin' come the
final bang as bu'sted Mrs. Macy! She got
a letter from a man as said he'd meet her
in the station an' tattoo her name right on
her in the ladies' waitin'-room, so as her
friends could easy find her an' know her
body at the morgue. Well, she said that
ended her. She says she never was one
to take to bein' stuck an' so she just up
an' wrote to Mrs. Lupey as she would n't
go for love or money&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why," cried Mrs. Lathrop, "then she
isn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," said Susan, "she isn't goin'. She
ain't got the courage an' it's cruel to force
her. I told her to give me the ticket an'
I'd go in her place."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">THE BIENNIAL</p>


<p>On the day that the Convention of
Women's Clubs opened, Mrs. Lathrop,
having seen her friend depart, composed
herself for a period of unmitigated
repose which might possibly last, she
thought, for several days. Susan had
awakened her very early that morning
to receive her back door key and minute
instructions regarding Elijah and the
chickens. Elijah had undertaken to look
after the chickens, but Miss Clegg stated
frankly that she should feel better during
her absence if her friend kept a sharp eye
on him during the process. "Elijah's got
a good heart," said the delegate, "but that
don't alter his bein' a man an' as a consequence
very poor to depend upon as to all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
things about the house. I don't say as
I lay it up against him for if he was like
Deacon White, an' had ideas of his own
as to starchin' an' butterin' griddles, he'd
drive me mad in no time, but still I shall
take it as a personal favor of you, Mrs.
Lathrop, if you'll ask him whenever you
see him if he's remembered all I told him,
an' <i>don't</i> let him forget the hen as is thinkin'
some of settin' in the wood shed, for if
she does it, she'll need food just as much
as if she does n't do it."</p>

<p>Then Miss Clegg departed, with her
valise, her bonnet in a box, and some
lunch in another box. She went early, for
the simple reason that the train did the
same thing, and as soon as she was gone
Mrs. Lathrop, as I before remarked, went
straight back to bed and to sleep again.
She had a feeling that for a while at least
no demand upon her energies could possibly
be made, and it was therefore quite a
shock to her when some hours later she
heard a vigorous pounding on her back door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>Stunned dizzy by the heavy slumber of
a hot July day, Mrs. Lathrop was some
minutes in getting to the door, and when
she got there, was some seconds in fumbling
at the lock with her dream-benumbed
fingers; but in the end she got it open, and
then was freshly paralyzed by the sight of
her friend, standing without, with her
valise, her bonnet-box, her lunch in the
other box, and the general appearance of
a weary soldier who has fought but not
exactly won.</p>

<p>"Why, Susan, I thought you&mdash;" began
Mrs. Lathrop, her mouth and eyes both
popping widely open.</p>

<p>"I did, an' I've got through an' I've
come home." Miss Clegg advanced into
the kitchen as she spoke and abruptly deposited
her belongings upon the table and
herself upon a chair. "I've been to the
convention," she said; then, "I've been to
the convention, an' I've got through with
that, too, an' I've got home from that,
too."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop, advancing
into a more advanced stage of perplexity,
as she came more fully to herself,
noted more fully her friend's exceedingly
battered appearance, and folding what she
had slipped on well about her, sought her
rocker.</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure," said Susan,
"it beats me what anybody else does it
for, either. But you must n't ask me questions,
Mrs. Lathrop, partly because I'm too
tired to answer them, an' partly because
I've come over to tell you anyhow an' I
can always talk faster when you don't try
to talk at the same time."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lathrop took a fresh wind-about
of her overgarment, and prepared to hold
her tongue more tightly than ever.</p>

<p>"In the first place," said Susan, speaking
in the highly uplifted key which we
are all apt to adopt under the stress of
great excitement mixed with great fatigue;
"in the first place, Mrs. Lathrop, you know
as Mrs. Macy insisted on keepin' the badge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
'cause she said she wanted to work it into
that pillow she's makin', so I had to get
along with the card as had her number on
it. As a consequence I naturally had a
very hard time, for I could n't find Mrs.
Lupey an' had to fiddle my own canoe
from the start clear through to the finish.
I can tell you I've had a hard day an' no
one need n't ever say Woman's Rights to
me never again. I'm too full of Women's
Wrongs for my own comfort from now on,
an' the way I've been treated this day
makes me willin' to be a turkey in a harem
before I'd ever be a delegate to nothin'
run by women again.</p>

<p>"In the first place when I got to the
train it was full an' while I was packin'
myself into the two little angles left by a
very fat man, a woman come through an'
stuck a little flag in my bonnet without
my ever noticin' what she done an' that
little flag pretty near did me up right in
the start. Seems, Mrs. Lathrop, as goin'
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>to a Woman's Convention makes you everybody's
business but your own from the
beginnin', an' that little flag as that woman
stuck in my bonnet was a sign to every one
as I was a delegate.</p>

<p>"I set with a very nice lady as asked
me as soon as she see the little flag if I
knowed how to tell a ham as has got consumption
from one as has n't. I told her I
did n't an' she talked about that till we
got to town, which made the journey far
from interestin' an' is goin' to make it
very hard for me to eat ham all the rest of
my life. Then we got out an' I got rid of
her, but that did n't help me much, for
I got two others as see the little flag right
off an' they never got off nor let up on me.
I was took to a table as they had settin'
in the station handy, put in their own
private census an' then give two books an'
a map an' seven programs an' a newspaper
an' a rose, all to carry along with my own
things, an' then a little woman with a little
black bag as had noticed the little flag too
took me away, an' said I need n't bother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
about a thing for I could go with her an'
welcome.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 438px;"><a name="gs02" id="gs02"></a>
<img src="images/gs02.jpg" width="438" height="724" alt="&quot;&#39;A lady come up, looked at my flag, an&#39; asked me if I was a

<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;A lady come up, looked at my flag, an&#39; asked me if I was a
delegate or an alternative.&#39;&quot; Page <a href="#Page_119">119</a></span>
</div>

<p>"I did n't want to go with her, welcome
or not, but they all seemed pleased with
the arrangement, so I went with her, an'
I was more'n a little mad for every time
I dropped the rose or a program, tryin' to
get rid of them, she'd see it an' pick it up
an' give it back to me. We walked a little
ways in that pleasant way an' then she
asked me how I was raisin' my children,
an' I said I did n't have none. She said,
'Oh my, what would Mr. Roosevelt say
to that?' and I said it was n't his affair
nor no other man's. I may in confidence
remark as by this time I was gettin' a little
warm, Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"We come to the convention hall after
a good long walk an' I was quite hot two
ways by that time, for I was mad an'
awful tired too. The little woman left me
then an' a lady come up, looked at my
flag, an' asked me if I was a delegate or
an alternative 'cause it was important to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
know right off in the beginnin'. I told her
I was for Mrs. Macy an' she got out a book
an' looked in it very carefully to see for
sure whether to believe me or not an' then
she told me to go on in. There was a door
as squeaked an' they pushed me through it
an' I found myself, bag, flag an' all, in the
convention.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop, I never see the
beat of that place in all my life. They'd
done what they could to make it cheerful
an' homelike by paintin' it green at one
end but it was plain to be seen as the paint
soon give out an' towards the top the man
as was paintin' must of give out too, for
he just finished up by doing a few circles
here an' there an' then left it mainly plain.
Below was all chairs an' they'd started to
decorate with banners but they'd given
out on banners even quicker than on paint
an' the most of the hall was most simple.</p>

<p>"I walked up as far towards the front as
I could an' then I sat down. I can't say as
I was very comfortable nor much impressed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
an' the folks further back was very restless
an' kept sayin' they could n't hear what
was goin' on on the platform. There was
a lady on the platform hammerin' a table
for dear life an' to my order of thinkin' anybody
must have been deaf as could n't have
heard her hammerin', but she looked happy
an' that was maybe the main thing, for a
woman behind me whispered as the spirit
of her with the hammer just filled the room.
Well, I stood it as long as I could an' then
I got up an' remarked frank an' open as if
every one would keep still every one could
easy hear. They all clapped at that, but
the lady with the hammer could n't seem
to even hear me an' hammered worse than
ever all the while they was clappin'.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop, to make a long
story short it was n't very interestin'&mdash;I
will even in confidence remark as I found
it pretty dull. I read all my seven programs
an' made out as the first day was
give to greetin' an' the next to meetin'.
The next was on trees an' the one after that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
they was all goin' to drive. An' so on,
an' so on. Then I smelt my rose some,
an' a thorn stuck into my nose some an'
the hammerin' made me very tired an'
finally a woman come in an' said I had her
seat so I give it to her with a glad heart
an' come out, an' I never was happier to
do anythin' in my whole life before. But
I was hardly out when a lady as I had n't
seen yet see my little flag an' pounced on
me an' said was I Miss Clegg? an' I did n't
see nothin' to be gained by sayin' I was n't
so I said Yes, I was.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop, that was pretty
near to bein' the beginnin' of my end.
That woman hustled me into a carriage,
give my valise to the driver an' told him
to be quick. I was too dumb did up by
her actions to be able to think of anythin'
to say so I just sit still, an' she pinned a
purple ribbon onto me an' told me she'd
read two of my books an' died laughin'
only to look at me. I was more than
afraid as she was crazy but she talked so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
fast I could n't even see a chance to open
my mouth so I did n't try.</p>

<p>"She said when they was gettin' ready
for the convention an' dividin' up celebrities
among themselves that she just took
me right off. She said as she was goin'
to give a lunch for me an' a dinner for me
an' I don't know what all. She was still
talkin' when the carriage stopped at a hotel.</p>

<p>"She said I must n't mind a hotel much
'cause her husband minded company more,
an' I did n't see any sort of meanin' to her
remark, but David in the lions' den was a
roarin' lion himself compared to me that
minute, so I just walked behind her an'
she took me in an' up in a elevator an' into
a room with a bathroom an' a bouquet an'
there she told me to give her the key of
the valise an' she'd unpack while I was
in the bath tub.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop, I'm sure I never
had no idea of needin' a bath that bad when
I set off for the city to-day, an' you'll maybe
be surprised at me bein' so wax about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
extra washin' in her hands, but I was so
wild to get away from her an' her steady
talk by that time, that I give her the key
an' went into the bathroom an' made up
my mind as I'd try a bath all over at once
for the first time in my life, seein' as there
did n't seem to be nothin' else to do, an'
the tub was handy.</p>

<p>"So I undressed an' when I was undressed
I begin to look where I was to leap. Well,
Mrs. Lathrop, you never see such a tub as
that tub in all your life before! There
was a hole in the middle of the bottom an'
the more water run in the more water run
out. At first I could n't see how I was
goin' to manage but after a while I figured
it out an' see as there was nothin' for me
to do but to sit on that hole an' paddle like
I was paid for it with both hands at once to
keep from being scalded while the tub filled
from two steady spurts one boilin' an' one of
ice water. Well, Mrs. Lathrop, I never felt
nothin' like that kind of a bath before!</p>

<p>"If I tried to wash anywhere as was at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
all difficult I lost my grip on the hole an'
the water went out with a swish as made
Niagara look like a cow's tail afore I could
possibly get in position again. I was n't
more 'n halfway down my washin' when
the awfulest noise begin outside an' the
convention itself was babes sleepin' in
soothin' syrup compared to whatever was
goin' on in that next room.</p>

<p>"I tell you I got out of that tub in a
hurry an' rubbed off as best I could with
a very thick towel marked 'Bath' as was
laid on the floor all ready, an' got into my
clothes an' went out.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop, you may believe
me or not just as you please, but it was
<i>another</i> lady with <i>another</i> delegate with
<i>another</i> purple ribbon an' <i>another</i> little flag.
The ladies was very mad an' the other
delegate was bitin' her lips an' lookin' out
the window. In the end the ladies was so
mad they went down to the telephone an'
left the delegate an' me alone in the room
together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop, you can believe
me or not just as you please, but that other
delegate asked me my name an' when I
told her she said it was her name, too.
Then she laughed until she cried an' said
she never hear anythin' to beat us. She
said it was all as clear as day to her an'
that she should write a story about it.
She said about all she got out of life was
writin' stories about it an' she never lost
a chance to make a good one. She said
she wished I'd stay with her an' I could
have half the bed an' half of that same tub
as long as I like.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop, the long an' short
of it was as I felt that no matter how kind
she was I would n't never be able to be
happy anywhere where I had to be around
with a woman who talked all the time, an'
sleep in a bed with another Susan Clegg, an'
wash in a tub as you have to stop up with
some of yourself, so I just took my things
an' come home by the noon train an' I'll
stay here one while now, too, I guess."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"I&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was just going to ask you where
you put it," said Miss Clegg, "I shall need
it to get in the back door."</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"I can get it myself," said her friend,
rising. "Well, good-bye. I won't deny as
I'm mad for my lunch won't be any the
better for ridin' to town an' back this hot
day, but the Lord fits the back to the
burden, so I guess Elijah will be able to
eat it, leastways if he don't he won't get
nothin' else,&mdash;I know <i>that</i>, for it was him
as got up the fine idea of sending a delegate
from the sewin' society to the convention
an' I don't thank him none for it, I know
<i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop, mildly.</p>

<p>"I ain't sure," said Miss Clegg. "Elijah
strikes me as more thorns than roses this
night. I never was one to feel a longin'
for new experiences, an' I've had too many
to-day, as he'll very soon learn to his sorrow
when he comes home to-night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="center">THE FAR EASTERN TROPICS</p>


<p>"You look&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop, solicitously,
one afternoon, when Susan
Clegg had come around by the gate to
enjoy a spell of mutual sitting and knitting.</p>

<p>"Well, I am," confessed Susan, unrolling
her ball and drawing a long breath; "I may
tell you in confidence, Mrs. Lathrop, as I
really never was more so. What with
havin' to look after Elijah's washin' an'
his mendin' an' his cookin' an' his room,
an' what with holdin' down his new ideas
an' explainin' to people as he did n't mean
what it sounds like when I ain't been able
to hold 'em down, I do get pretty well wore
out. I can see as Mr. Kimball sees how
Elijah is wearin' on me for he gives me a
chair whenever I go in there now an' that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
just shows how anxious he is for me to
rest when I can, but it really ain't altogether
Elijah's fault for the way my back
aches to-day, for I got this ache in a way
as you could n't possibly understand, Mrs.
Lathrop, for I got it from sittin' up readin'
a book last night as you or any ordinary
person would of gone to sleep on the second
page of an' slept clear through to the
index; but I was built different from you
an' ordinary persons, Mrs. Lathrop, an' if
I'd thanked the Lord as much as I'd
ought to for that I'd never have had time
to do nothin' else in <i>this</i> world."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop, with
interest.</p>

<p>"It was a book," said her friend, beginning
to knit assiduously&mdash;"a book as a
boy he went to school with sent Mr. Fisher
with a postal card, sayin' as every American
man 'd ought to read it thoughtfully. Mrs.
Fisher took it out of the post office an' read
the postal card, an' she said right off as
she did n't approve of Mr. Fisher's reading<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
books as every man ought to know, so she
let me have it to bring home an' read till
she gets through makin' over her carpets.
I brought the book home done up to look
like it was a pie, an' I will frankly state,
Mrs. Lathrop, as you could have dropped
me dead out of any balloon when I found
out what it was about. It was n't the kind
of book the postal card would have led you
to suppose a <i>tall</i>&mdash;it was about Asia,
Mrs. Lathrop, the far side or the near side,
just accordin' to the way you face to get
the light while you read, an' so far from its
bein' only intended for men it's all right
for any one at all to read as has got the
time. Now that I'm done it an' know
I have n't never got to do it again, I don't
mind telling you in confidence that for a
book as could n't possibly have been meant
to be interestin' it was about as agreeable
readin' as I ever struck in my life. There
was lots in it as was new to me, for it's a
thick book, an' all I knowed about that part
of the world before was as Java coffee comes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
from Java an' the Philippines from Spain.
But I know it all now, an' Judge Fitch
himself can't tell me nothin' from this day
on that the man who wrote that book
ain't told me first. I'll bet I know more
about what that book 's about than any one
in this community does, an' now that I
know it I see why the man said what he
did on the postal card for it <i>is</i> a book as
every man ought to read, an' I read in the
paper the other day as the main trouble
with the men in America was as they
knowed all about what they did n't know
nothin' about, an' did n't know nothin'
a <i>tall</i> about the rest."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;" began Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"But I don't see how the man that wrote
it is ever goin' to make any money out of
it," pursued her friend, "for it's pretty
plain as it's every bit written about things
that Americans don't want to really learn
an' what the rest of the world learned long
ago. If I was very patriotic I don't believe
I'd have read it clear through to the end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
myself, but I ain't never felt any call to be
patriotic since the boys throwed that firecracker
into my henhouse last Fourth of
July. I will say this for the hen, Mrs.
Lathrop, an' that is that she took the firecracker
a good deal calmer'n I could, for
I was awful mad, an' any one as seed me
ought to of felt what a good American was
spoiled then an' there, for all I asked was
to hit somethin', whether it was him as
throwed the cracker or not an' that's what
Judge Fitch always calls the real American
spirit when he makes them band-stand
speeches of his in the square. Oh my,
though, but I wish you had n't reminded
me of that hen, Mrs. Lathrop, her tail never
will come in straight again I don't believe,
an' she's forever hoppin' off her eggs to
look out of the window since she had that
scare."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lathrop frowned and looked very
sympathetic.</p>

<p>"But about this book," Susan went on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>after a second of slightly saddened reflection.
"I'm goin' to tell you all about it.
Elijah 's goin' to write a editorial about it,
too. Elijah says this business of downtreadin'
our only colony has got to be
stopped short right now as soon as he can
call the government's attention to how to
do it.</p>

<p>"Well, the book begins very mild an'
pleasant with Hongkong an' it ends with
the Philippine accounts. Seems Hongkong
ain't Chinese for all it's named that an'
growed there&mdash;it's English&mdash;an' as for
the Philippines there's eight millions of
'em, not countin' the wild ones as they
can't catch to count an' ask questions. In
between Hongkong an' the Philippines the
man who wrote the book runs around that
part of the world pretty lively an' tells who
owns it an' what kind of roads they've got
an' who'd better govern 'em an' all like
that. You might think from hearin' me as
he sort of put on airs over knowin' so much
himself, but it don't sound that way a <i>tall</i>
in the book. It's when he finally got to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the Philippines as any one can see as he
really did begin to enjoy himself. He
enjoyed himself so much that he really
made me enjoy myself, too, although I
can't in reason deny as I felt as I might not
of been quite so happy only for that firecracker.
The kind of things he says about
our doin's in those countries is all what you
don't get in the papers nor no other way,
an' if the United States really feels they're
in the right as to how they're actin' all
they need to do is to read how wrong they
are in that book where a man as really knows
what he's talkin' about has got it all set
down in black an' white. I don't believe
it's generally knowed here in America as
Dewey took Aguinaldo an' his guns over
to Manila an' give him his first start at
fightin' an' called him 'general' for a long
time after they'd decided in Washington
as how he was n't nothin' but a rebel after
all. I never knowed anythin' about that,
an' I will remark as I think there's many
others as don't know it, neither, an' I may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
in confidence remark to you, Mrs. Lathrop,
as that book leads me to think as the main
trouble with the Philippines is as they are
bein' run by folks as don't know anythin'
about the place they're runnin' an' don't
know nothin' about runnin' for anythin'
but places. The man in the book says the
Philippines ain't very well off being pacified,
an' that the Americans ain't no great
success pacifyin' 'em, for it seems as they
made five thousand expeditions after 'em
in one year, an' only got hold of five
thousand natives in all. That's a expedition
to a man, an' I will say, Mrs. Lathrop,
as it's small wonder we're taxed an' they're
taxed, with some of our new fellow citizens
as hard to grab as that. To my order of
thinkin' it'd be wisest to let 'em chase
each other for ten or twenty years first an'
then when they was pretty well thinned
out we could step in an' settle with the
survivors; but accordin' to the man who
wrote the book you can't never tell a
American nothin', an' I must say that my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
own experience in this community has
proved as he knows what he's sayin' all
straight enough. He says the Philippines
is in a very bad way, an' so is their roads,
but he says that all the folks in this country
is so dead satisfied with their way an' poor
roads that they ain't goin' to do nothin'
to help either along any."</p>

<p>"Did&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"He says," continued Susan, "that the
United States is just so happy sittin' back
an' observin' the Philippines, an' the Philippines
is so far off that if they die of
starvation while being observed no one'll
ever be the wiser. He says the United
States is payin' for the army, an' the
Philippines is tryin' to live with it, an'
seein' as they don't work much an' the
Chinese is forbidden to work for 'em, he
don't see no help nowhere. What he said
about the Chinese was very interestin',
for I never see one close to, an' it seems
they're a clean race only for likin' to raise
pigs in their garrets. It seems, too, as if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
you let 'em into any country they'll work
very hard an' live very cheap an' pay most
of the taxes with the duty on opium as
they've got to eat, an' games as they've
got to play."</p>

<p>"I sh'd think&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop,
looking startled.</p>

<p>"Well, I should, too," said Susan, "but
accordin' to the book the Philippines ain't
to be allowed any such luxury as havin'
the Chinese to develop their country an'
pay their taxes. No sir, they've all got
to go to school an' learn English first, an'
although he says right out plain that the
Philippines needs Chinese an' good roads
a deal worse 'n they need the army an' the
schools, still it's the army an' the schools
as America is going to give them, an' they
can get along without the roads an' the
Chinese as best they can. They certainly
must be gettin' a good deal of schoolin',
but the man says all the teachers teach is
English, an' as none of the children can
speak English they don't get much learned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
I thought I could sort of see that he thought
we 'd ought to of straightened out the South
of our own country afore we begun on any
other part of the world, an' it <i>is</i> the other
half of the world, too, Mrs. Lathrop, for I
looked it up on a map an' it begins right
under Japan an' then twists off in a direction
as makes you wonder how under the
sun we come to own it anyway, an' if we
did accidentally get it hooked on to us by
Dewey's having too much steam up to be
able to stop himself afore he'd run over
the other fleet, we'd ought anyway to be
willin' to give it away like you do the
kittens you ain't got time to drown. The
whole back of the book is full of figures to
prove as it's the truth as has been told in
front, but the man who wrote it didn't
think much of even the figures in the
Philippines for he says they put down some
of what they spend in Mexican money an'
some in American an' don't tell what they
spend the most of it for in either case. He
says he met some very nice men there an'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
they was workin' the best they knew how
but they did n't think things were goin'
well themselves an' it's plain to be seen
that he spoke of 'em just like you give a
child a cooky after a spankin'. What
interested me most was there's a Malay
country over there as the English began
on twenty-five years ago an' have got
railroaded an' telegraphed an' altogether
civilized now, an' we've had the Philippines
ten years an' ain't even got the live ones
quieted down yet."</p>

<p>"What do you&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop,
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Oh," said her friend, "I ain't never had
no ideas on the Philippine question since
Judge Fitch got his brother made a captain
in the war just because he was tired supportin'
him. Mr. Kimball said then as
all wars was just got up to use up the
folks as respectable people did n't want to
have around no longer an' I must say as
I believe him. Mr. Weskin told me as it's
been quietly knowed around for hundreds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
of years as the crusades was a great success
as far as gettin' 'em off was concerned just
for that very reason, an' I guess we're
hangin' on to the Philippines because it's
a place a good long ways off to send poor
relations after good salaries. The man who
wrote the book said a man did n't need
to know hardly anythin' to go there an'
I must say from what I see of the few who
have come back they don't look like they
spent much spare time studyin' up while
they was in the country."</p>

<p>Susan stopped knitting suddenly and
stuck her needles into the ball.</p>

<p>"I've got to go home," she said. "I've
just remembered as I forgot to fill the tea-kettle.
Well, Mrs. Lathrop, we've had a
nice talk about our foreign possessions an'
all I can say in the end is as that whole
book made me feel just like we'd all ought
to get to feel as quick as we can. Lots of
things in this world might be better only
the people that could change 'em don't
often feel inclined that way, an' the people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
who'd like to have a change ain't the ones as
have got any say. If I was a Philippine I'd
want a Chinaman to do my work an' I'd
feel pretty mad that folks as had so many
niggers an' Italians that they did n't need
Chinamen should say I could n't have 'em
neither. I'd feel as if I knowed what was
best for me an' I would n't thank a lot of
men in another part of the world for sittin'
down on my ideas. However, there's one
thing that comforted me very much in the
book. All the countries around <i>is</i> run, an'
pretty well run too, by other countries an'
if the Philippines get too awful tired of
being badly run by us all those of 'em as
know anythin' can easy paddle across to
some of them well run countries in the front
half of the book to live, an' as for the
rest&mdash;"</p>

<p>Susan stopped short. Mrs. Lathrop was
sound asleep!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">THE EVILS OF DELAYED DECEASE</p>


<p>"I ain't been doin' my duty by Mrs.
Macy lately," said Susan Clegg to
Mrs. Lathrop; "I declare to goodness I've
been so did up with the garden an' Elijah
an' house cleanin' this last two weeks that
I don't believe I've even thought of the
other side of the crick since I begun. I
ain't seen Mrs. Macy either an' maybe
that's one reason why I ain't done nothin'
about her, but it ain't surprisin' as I ain't
seen her for she ain't been here&mdash;she's
been over in Meadville stayin' with the
Lupeys, an' I must say I'm right put out
with Elijah for not puttin' it in the paper
so I'd of knowed it afore. The idea of
Mrs. Macy bein' in Meadville for over a
week an' me not hearin' of it is a thing as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
makes me feel as maybe when Gabriel
blows his horn I'll just merely sit up an'
say, 'Did you call?' But anyway she's been
away an' she's got back, an' when I heard
it in the square to-day I did n't mince up
no matters none but I just set my legs in
her direction an' walked out there as fast
as I could. It does beat all how many
changes can come about in two weeks!&mdash;four
more pickets has been knocked off
the minister's fence an' most every one has
hatched out their chickens since I was
that way last, but I was n't out picketin'
or chickenin'; I was out after Mrs. Macy
an' I just kept a-goin' till I got to her."</p>

<p>"Was she&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Yes, she was," replied Susan, "an' thank
the most kind an' merciful Heavens, there
was n't no one else there, so she an' I
could just sit down together, an' it was n't
nothin' but joy for her to tell me hide an'
hair an' inside out of her whole visit. She
got back day before yesterday an' she
had n't even unpacked her trunk yet she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
was that wore out; you can judge from
that how wore out she really is, for you
know yourself, Mrs. Lathrop, as when
Mrs. Macy is too wore out to dive head
over heels into things, whether her own or
other folks', she's been pretty well beat
down to the ground. She was mighty
glad to see me, though, even if she did n't
come to the door, but only hollered from
a chair, an' I don't know as I ever had a
nicer call on her, for she went over everythin'
inside out an' hind side before, an'
it was nothin' but a joy for me to listen,
for it seems she had a pretty sad visit first
an' last what with being specially invited
to sit up an' watch nights with Mrs. Kitts
an' then stay to the funeral&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Funeral!" cried Mrs. Lathrop,&mdash;"I
nev&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For after bein' specially invited to help
lay her out an' go to the funeral," Susan repeated
calmly, "Mrs. Kitts did n't die a <i>tall</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mrs. Lathrop, terminating the
whole of a remark, for once.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said Susan, "an' every one else
feels the same as you do about it, too, but
it seems as it was n't to be this time. Mrs.
Macy says as she never went through
nothin' to equal these ten days dead or
alive, an' she hopes so help her heaven to
never sit up with anybody as has got anythin'
but heart disease or the third fit of
apoplexy hereafter. Why, she says Mr.
Dill's eleven months with Mrs. Dill flat on
her back was a child playin' with a cat an'
a string in comparison to what the Lupeys
an' her have been goin' through with Mrs.
Kitts these ten days. She says all Meadville
is witness to the way she's skinned
'em down to the bone. Mrs. Dill was give
up by a doctor like a Christian, an' after
the eleven months she <i>did</i> die, but Mrs.
Kitts has been give up over an' over by
doctor after doctor till there ain't one in
the whole place as ain't mad at her about
it; an' there she is livin' yet! Mrs. Macy
says Mrs. Lupey is so wore out she can't
talk of nothin' else. Mrs. Lupey feels very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
bitter over it; she says it's all of six years
now since they turned the X-rays through
her (an' Mrs. Macy says as Mrs. Lupey says
she could sit right down an' cry to think
how much them X-rays cost an' how little
good they done), an' she says it's three
years come April Fool's since old Dr. Carter
tried her lungs with his new kinetoscope
an' found 'em full of air an' nothin' else.
Mrs. Lupey says she's always had so much
faith in old Dr. Carter an' she had faith in
him then, an' was so sweet an' trustin'
when he come with the machine, an' after
he was done she fully believed his word
of honor as to everythin', an' that was
why they went an' bought her that bell
an' oh heavens alive, Mrs. Lathrop, I only
wish you <i>could</i> hear Mrs. Macy on Mrs.
Kitts' bell! It seems that kind of bell
is a new invention an' as soon as any one is
give up for good the doctor as gives 'em
up sends a postal to the man as keeps 'em,
an' then the man sends it for three days on
trial an' then the family buy it, because it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
lets 'em all sleep easy. Well, Mrs. Macy
says it's the quietest lookin' small thing
you ever see, but she says Great Scott,
Holy Moses, an' ginger tea, the way it
works! You only need to put your hand
on it an' just stir it an' it unhooks inside
like one of them new patent mouse traps
as catch you ten times to every once they
catch a mouse, an' then it begins to ring
like a fire alarm an' bang like the Fourth of
July, an' it don't never stop itself again
until some one as is perfectly healthy comes
tearin' barefoot from somewhere to turn
it over an' hook it up an' get Mrs. Kitts
whatever she wants."</p>

<p>"I should&mdash;" suggested Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"I guess they would, too," said Susan;
"I guess they'd be only too glad to. Why,
Mrs. Macy says Mrs. Lupey says as it was
all they could do to live in the house with
her mother when she did n't have nothin'
but a stick to pound on the floor with, but
she says since she's got that bell&mdash;!
Well! Mrs. Macy says as they're all four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
worn into just frazzles with it, an' Judy is
got so nervous with it going off sudden
when Busby an' she is thinkin' about other
things that she begins twitchin' the minute
the bell begins ringin' an' they've had to
hire a electric battery to soothe her with
while Faith an' Maria is racin' for the bell.
Mrs. Macy says it's somethin' just awful
first, last, an' forever, an' Mrs. Lupey told
her in confidence as it was Heaven's own
truth as they had n't none of them woke
of their own accords once since it was
bought."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Macy says she's a pretty
good judge of sick folks an' she judged
Mrs. Kitts for all she was worth, an' she
could n't feel as she ought in politeness to
say anythin' 'cause the Lupeys sent her
the round-trip ticket to go an' come back
with. But she says just between her an'
me an' not to let it go any further, that to
<i>her</i> order of thinkin' (an' she'll take her
Bible oath to it anywhere) Mrs. Kitts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
looks like one of those oldest survivor kinds
as they print in the city Sunday papers
every week. She says she ain't got the
quiet, give-up manner of a person as is
really quiet an' really givin' up&mdash;she's
got the spry air of a person as likes to keep
the whole family jumpin' quick whenever
they speak. She says Mrs. Lupey says as
she really does get awful low just often
enough to keep their courage up, but Mrs.
Macy says Mrs. Lupey is easy fooled because
them's the sort as outlives all their families
in the end always. But seems as her gettin'
low an' then raisin' up again ain't the only
tough part for it seems as she was so low
last fall that they really felt safe to send
Maria up to the city to buy their mournin'
at a bargain sale for there's four of 'em
an' they want the veils thick so they'll
look sorry from the outside anyhow. And
Maria did go, an'&mdash; Well, Mrs. Lathrop,
I will say as to hear about it all does go
through one even if it ain't my personal
crape! Seems as the clerk asked Maria<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
if it was for a deep family mournin' or just
a light friendly mournin', an' Maria told
him it was <i>goin'</i> to be for her grandmother.
Seems he was n't very polite about it,
coughed a good deal behind his hand an'
such doin's, until Maria got real vexed an'
so mad over thinkin' as maybe it was n't
all coughin' as he was keepin' his hand
over that she lost her wits an' went to
work an' bought most twice the crape she
needed just to show him as she was n't
tryin' to save nothin' on her grandmother,
whatever <i>he</i> might think. So now Mrs.
Macy says, added to Mrs. Kitts an' the
bell they've got the care of all that crape
on their hands, an' the damp gathers in
it just awful on rainy days, an' of course
no Christian can sun twenty yards of crape
on their clothesline when the dead person
ain't died yet, so they're wild over that,
too. They've made their skirts themselves,
an' they wanted to do their waists,
only what with the way sleeves is puffin'
out an' slimmin' up an' fronts is first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
hangin' over an' then hookin' down, the
back it just does seem out of the question.
They've worried a lot over the veils since
they was bought 'cause they wanted to get
into 'em last winter so as to get out of 'em
by last spring, an' then even when Mrs.
Kitts rallied from her Christmas dinner,
they thought maybe they could still be
out of 'em by the Fourth of July; but
now&mdash;Heavens! Mrs. Macy says they
don't ask to get out of 'em any more; all
they ask is to get <i>into</i> 'em, an' goodness
knows when that is <i>ever</i> goin' to happen.
She says Mrs. Lupey says what with Judy's
divorce an' Mrs. Kitts livin' right along
she's going to get moths into her things
for the first time in her life, she just knows
she is. It's a pretty hard case any one
can see, an' of course seein' Mrs. Kitts live
like that may get Busby Bell all out of the
notion of marryin' Judy, for of course no
man ain't goin' to like to look forward to
Mrs. Lupey's livin' like that too, maybe&mdash;or
maybe Judy 'll live herself&mdash;you never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
can tell. Mrs. Macy says Mrs. Lupey says
she never guessed as sorrow could come so
near to breakin' your back as losin' a grandmother
is breakin' theirs. She says when
she's really lost it won't be so bad 'cause
they can all put on their crape veils an' go
straight to bed an' to sleep, but she says
this long drawn out losin' of her with that
bell throwed into the bargain is somethin'
calculated to make a saint out of a Chinaman,
an' nothin' more nor less."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"I tell you, they <i>can't</i>," said Susan;
"they want to bad enough, but they can't
do it. Mrs. Kitts is too smart for that.
She keeps her eagle eye on it awake, an'
her whole hand on the little string when
she's asleep, an' drums 'em up to know
if the clock is really right, or if she feels
anyways disposed to smell of cologne.
Some nights she rolls on the string in her
sleep, an' then the bell wakes her along
with the rest of 'em, which Mrs. Macy says
is a-doin' more aggravatin' to the Lupeys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
than any words can do justice to. Mrs.
Macy says as she really does believe that
if Mrs. Kitts took a fancy to oysters in
August she'd be fully equal to ringin' that
bell for 'em till September came an' they
could get 'em for her. She says it would
be just like her, she does declare. Mrs.
Macy says she sit with Mrs. Kitts considerable
an' Mrs. Kitts was very pleasant to
her, an' give her two pair of black lace
mitts an' a pin, but she found out afterwards
as the mitts was Mrs. Lupey's an'
the pin was Maria's, so after that she see
just how the family felt about her an' her
ways. Mrs. Macy says the whole thing is
a tragedy right out of Shakespeare an' the
only pleasant thing about her whole visit
was as it did n't cost her nothin'."</p>

<p>"Did she&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I forgot to tell you about that.
She see him four times. I don't know as
she wants it generally known, but I wanted
to know about it so I got it out of her. It
does beat all, Mrs. Lathrop, how a woman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
of Mrs. Macy's sense, with a income that's
only a little too small to get along on, can
want to marry any man again. But she
seems kind of crazy on the idea, an' if it
ain't Mr. Dill, it's goin' to be Dr. Carter,
or bu'st, with her. She says she went to
his office just to let him know she was in
Meadville, an' then she see him on the
street, an' then she went to his office again
to ask him his real opinion of Mrs. Kitts,
an' then just before she left she went to
his office again to let him know as she was
goin' to come back here. So she see him
four times in all."</p>

<p>"What did&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Oh, he told her as he would n't be surprised
if any of 'em died any day. That
is, any of 'em except Mrs. Kitts. He did n't
seem to think as Mrs. Kitts would ever die."</p>

<p>"What do&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Oh, I saw there was nothin' else as
Mrs. Macy could talk about just now so
I come home an' then I come over here. I
declare though, Mrs. Lathrop, I can't help<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
bein' a little blue to-night. Of course I
ain't any real relation to you, but we've
been neighbors so long that I can't help
feelin' a little bit uneasy over thinkin' of
Mrs. Kitts an' wonderin' how long you
may be goin' to live in the end."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="center">THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY</p>


<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop," said Susan
Clegg one pleasant May evening,
as she and her devoted listener leaned their
elbows on the top rail of the fence, "I can't
but thank Heaven as these boards is the
only thing as you ever take opposite sides
from me on. I don't say as your never
disagreein' ain't sometimes wearin', but
there <i>are</i> days as I feel I'd enjoy a little
discussion an' then Elijah an' I discuss on
those days till it seems like I can't live to
get to you an' do it all alone by myself.
Elijah's a very young man but he's a man
after all an' there's somethin' about a man
as makes him not able to see any side of
anythin' except his own side. Now it
don't make any difference what we talk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
about I <i>always</i> take the other side, an' I
will in confidence remark as the South
fightin' Grant had a easy job compared to
me tryin' to get Elijah to see any side but
his own. Elijah's a very pig-headed young
man an' I declare I don't know I'm sure
what ailed him last night&mdash;seemed as if
he was up a tree about somethin' as made
him just wild over the Democratic party.
I must say&mdash;an' I said it to his face, too&mdash;as
to my order of thinkin' takin' sides
about the Democrats nowadays is like
takin' sides with Pharaoh after the Red
Sea had swallowed him an' all his chariots
up forever, but Elijah never gives up to
no man, an' he said, not so, the Democrats
was still ready to be the salvation of the
country if only Bryan would give 'em a
chance. He says they 've been handicapped
so far an' it's very tryin' for any party to
have to choose between a donkey an' a
tiger for its picture of itself, for no sensible
person likes to have to ride on either, an'
no politics could <i>ever</i> make a success of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
donkey for a mascot, whether you judge
him from his ears or his heels. I had it
in my mind to say somethin' then about
turnin' around an' takin' a fresh start with
a fresh animal as a sensible person would
find it nothin' but a joy to ride, but Elijah,
like all newspapers, rips a thing up the
back an' then shows you how you can't
do better than to sew up the tear an' go on
wearin' it again, so after he'd skinned the
donkey an' the tiger both alive, so to speak,
he went on to say as never's a long game
an' him laughs best who keeps sober longest
an' altogether his own feelin' was as
America 'll soon perceive her only hope
lays in electin' a new Democratic party.
I just broke in then an' told him it looked
to me as if the natural run of mankind
would n't let Grover Cleveland skip eight
years an' then try it again more 'n six
times more, an' that if the Republicans
keep it up as they have awhile longer no
money won't be able to get 'em out 'cause
they'll have all the money there is in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
country right in with them, but by that
time Elijah'd got his breath, an' he just
shook his head an' asked me if I remembered
what a lot of fuss the first billion dollar
congress made an' if I'd observed how
calm they was took now? I told him I
had an' then we went at it hammer an'
tongs, Elijah for the Democrats an' me
against 'em, although I must say I wished
he'd give me the other side, for in spite of
their actin' so silly I must say I always
have a feelin' as the most of the Democrats
is tryin' to be honest which is somethin'
as even their best friend couldn't say of
the most of the Republicans as a general
thing."</p>

<p>"Did&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did, an' I don't know but we'd
be talkin' yet only Mr. Dill come in on us to
ask me if I would n't consider takin' Gran'ma
Mullins to board for a month or two,
just to see how Hiram an' Lucy would get
along if they had the house all alone to
themselves."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>"What&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Well, I told him I'd think about it,"
said Miss Clegg. "I don't know I'm sure
why I should bed an' board Gran'ma
Mullins to help Lucy an' Hiram to try to
get along any better. They 're a good deal
more interestin' to talk about the way
they're gettin' along now. I never see
Mrs. Macy but what she has somethin'
amusin' to tell me about Hiram an' Lucy
an' Gran'ma Mullins, an' I like to hear it.
She says the other night they was all three
runnin' round the house one after another
for a hour an' she said she most died laughin'
to watch 'em. Seems Lucy got mad an'
started to run after Hiram to pull his hair,
an' Gran'ma Mullins was so scared for fear
she <i>would</i> pull his hair that she run after
Lucy to ask her not to do it. Hiram run
so much faster than Lucy that finally he
caught up with Gran'ma Mullins an' then
they all went to bed. Mrs. Macy says
that's the way they act all the time, an'
she certainly would n't see any more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
I should why I should break up the family.
I'm sure I never cooked up that marriage
an' I told Mr. Dill so. I asked him why
he did n't take Gran'ma Mullins to board
with him, if he was so wild to get her away
from Lucy, but he said he did n't think it'd
be proper, an' I said I did n't say nothin'
about <i>bed</i>&mdash;I just spoke about board,
an' if there was anythin' as was n't proper
about boardin' Gran'ma Mullins he'd ought
not to of mentioned the subject to me."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Oh, there was n't nothin' left for him
to say then, of course; but law! I did n't
see no use mooley-cowin' around Mr. Dill;
what I wanted was for him to go so Elijah
an' me could go on discussin'. Elijah
thinks our paper ought to come out strong
now that we've got one an' he said he would
in confidence remark to me as he intended
to say some very pointed things soon. He
says all the editors in the country know
as the plans an' the parties is all fixed
up beforehand nowadays; the Republicans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
say how many they'll have in each state
an' then they never fail to have 'em an'
that's a national disgrace for nobody ought
to know beforehand how a election is goin'
to pan out for it would n't be possible if
folks was anyways honest. He says for
a carefully planned an' worked up thing
a Republican victory is about the tamest
surprise as this country ever gets nowadays,
an' yet we keep on gettin' them an' openin'
our eyes over 'em every four years like
they was somethin' new.</p>

<p>"I bu'st in then an' said as there was
sure to come a change afore long with
prices goin' up like they is an' a reaction
bound to drop in the end. Elijah laughed
then an' said he knowed well enough as
when the deluge come the Republicans
would grab the Democrats an' hold 'em just
like that rich man who grabbed the clerk
an' held him in front of him, when they
throwed that bomb at him in his office."</p>

<p>"At the&mdash;" cried Mrs. Lathrop, opening
her eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, the bomb was meant for him, but
he held the clerk in front of him so the
clerk caught it all. That's what they call
presence of mind, an' as far as my observation 's
extended, Mrs. Lathrop, the Republicans
have got full as much of it&mdash;they
must have, for they both make money
right straight along an' I've observed myself
as they always step out when a crash
comes an' let the Democrats in to do the
economizin' till there's enough money saved
up to make it worth while for them to take
hold again which comes to much the same
thing in the end. I tell you, Mrs. Lathrop,
I see after a little as it was n't no use
talkin' to Elijah so I just had to listen to
him an' he really did kind of frighten me
in the end. Livin' with an editor an'
readin' that book of Mr. Fisher's has opened
my eyes to a many new ideas. I've lived
in a small town all my life but I've got
brains an' there's no use denyin' as a
woman with brains can apply 'em to the
president just as easy as to the minister,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
once she gets to thinkin' on the subject.
This country is in a very bad way an' it's
all owin' to our bein' satisfied with what's
told us an' not lookin' into nothin' for
ourselves. We've got the Philippines now
an' we've got Hawaii an' we've got the
niggers an' we've got ever so many other
things. We've got the Mormons down
to one wife as a general thing an' the
Italians comin' in by the thousands an'
more old soldiers bein' born every year an'
the fifth generation of Revolutionary orphans
out filin' their pensions&mdash;an' we
owe 'em all to the Republicans. Elijah
says we owe 'em a lot else, too, but I think
that's enough in all conscience. Elijah
says too it costs a third more to live than
it did ten years ago an' he knows that for
a fact, an' you an' I know that, too, Mrs.
Lathrop. Coal's gone up an' everythin'
else. I tell you I got kind of blue, thinkin'
about it after I went to bed last night an'
it took me a long time to remember as
Elijah was maybe more upset over not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
bein' able to go an' see 'Liza Em'ly on
account of the rain, than anythin' else;
but then too, Mr. Shores is very much
cast down over the country, only I must
admit as it's more 'n likely as he ain't
really half as mournful over the Democrats
as he is over his wife; an' then there's
Judge Fitch as is always mad over politics
an' we all know that that's just 'cause he's
always been called 'judge' ever since he
was born, an' nobody ain't never made
him judge of nothin' bigger 'n us yet. I
guess if he was sure as our paper could get
him elected to congress he'd cheer up
pretty quick, but he told me yesterday as
Elijah did n't know how to conduct a
campaign to his order of thinkin'. He
don't like that cut of Elijah's being David
to the city papers bein' Goliath. He says a
cut to do him any good had ought to have
him in it somewhere an' I don't know but
what he's right.</p>

<p>"But, Mrs. Lathrop, we are mighty bad
off an' that's a fact, but still I will say this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
much an' that is that as far as my observation 's
extended folks as complains openly
of anythin' is always findin' fault with the
thing because there's some secret thing as
they can't find fault openly with, like
Elijah an' the rain, an' Mr. Shores an' his
wife. The world's great for takin' its
private miseries out publicly in some other
direction, an' my own feelin' is as the
Democrats is a great comfort to every one
as the Republicans can't very conveniently
give nothin' to these days. If the president
was to suddenly make Sam Duruy a
minister to somewhere there'd be a great
change of opinion as to politics in this town,
you'd see. It would n't give Sam any
more brains, but every one 'd be pleased an'
the Democrats would n't cut no figure
no more."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"That's just it," said Susan, "that's
just the trouble. We're like most of the
rest of America an' the whole of Cuba an'
the Philippines, too little an' too far off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
to make the big folks really care whether
we like the way they do or not. I don't
have no idea of carin' whether potato bugs
mind bein' picked or not, an' no matter
what they said about me before or after
their pickin' it 'd be all one to me. An'
that's just about the way our government
feels about us. An' I guess most other
governments is much the same. Which
is probably the reason why potato bugs is
gettin' worse an' thicker all the time."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">THE TRIALS OF MRS. MACY</p>


<p>As Susan set the basket down it began
to squawk.</p>

<p>"I don't care," she said, "let it squawk!"</p>

<p>"But what&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop, in
whose kitchen Susan had set the basket
down and in whose kitchen chair Susan
was now sitting herself down.</p>

<p>"Let it squawk," Susan repeated; "I
guess it's made trouble enough for others
so that I may in all confidence feel to set
a little while without troublin' about it
myself. I look upon it that I was very
kind to take it anyhow, not havin' no idea
how it'll agree with the chickens when it
comes to eatin' with them or with me
when it comes to me eatin' it, for you know
as I never was one as cared for 'em, Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Lathrop, but still a friend is a friend, an'
in Mrs. Macy's state to-night the least her
friends could do was for Gran'ma Mullins
to stay with her an' for me to take the
duck. Gran'ma Mullins was willing to sit
up with a under-the-weather neighbor, but
she said she could <i>not</i> take a duck on her
mind too, an' a spoiled duck at that, for
I will in confidence remark, Mrs. Lathrop,
as you only need to be in the room with
that duck two minutes to see as the Prodigal
Son was fully an' freely whipped in
comparison to the way as he's been dealt
with."</p>

<p>"I really&mdash;" protested Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know but it <i>will</i> be savin'
of breath in the end," said Miss Clegg, and
thereupon she arose, laid hold of the squawking
basket, bore it into the next room, and
coming out, shut the connecting door
firmly behind her.</p>

<p>"Where under the&mdash;" began Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"It's really quite a long story," returned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
her friend; "but I come in just to tell
you, anyhow. It's Mrs. Macy's story an'
it begun when she went in town yesterday
mornin', an' it's a story of her trials, an'
I will say this for Mrs. Macy, as more trials
right along one after another I never hear
of an' to see her sittin' there now in her
carpet slippers with a capsicum plaster to
her back an' Gran'ma Mullins makin' her
tea every minute she ain't makin' her
toast is enough to make any one as is as
soft an' tender-hearted as I am take any
duck whether it's spoiled or not. An' so
I took this duck."</p>

<p>"Well, I&mdash;" exclaimed Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"You think not now," said Susan, "but
you soon will when I tell you, for as I said
before, I come over just to tell you, an' I'm
goin' to begin right off. It's a long story
an' one as 'll take time to tell, but you know
me an' you know as I always take time to
tell you everythin' so you can rely on
gettin' the whole hide an' hair of this;
an' you'll get it fresh from the spout too,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
for I'm just fresh from Mrs. Macy an'
Mrs. Macy's so fresh from her trials that
they was still holdin' the plaster on to her
when I left."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" expostulated the listener.</p>

<p>"Well, now this is how it was," said Miss
Clegg; "an' I'll begin 'way back in the
beginnin' so you 'll have it all straight, for
it's very needful to have it straight so as
to understand just why she is so nigh to
half mad. For Mrs. Macy is n't one as
gets mad easy, an' so it's well for us as has
got to live in the same town with her to
well an' clearly learn just how much it
takes to use her up.</p>

<p>"Seems, Mrs. Lathrop, as yesterday
mornin' Mrs. Macy set out to go to town
to buy her some shoes. Seems as she was
goin' to take lunch with Busby Bell's
cousin Luther Stott's wife as she met at
the Lupeys' in Meadville, 'cause they only
live three-quarters of an hour from town
on two changes of the electric, an' Mrs.
Stott told Mrs. Lupey as any time she or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
her relations got tired of shoppin' she'd
be nothin' but happy to have 'em drop in
on her to rest 'cause she kept a girl an' her
husband's sister, too, so company was n't
no work for her herself. Well, Mrs. Macy
was goin' to the city an' so she looked up
the address an' made up her mind to go
there to lunch, an' so she wrote the address
on one side of the piece of paper as she had in
her black bag an' she wrote her shoes on the
other side, for she says they're a new kind
of shoes as is warranted not to pinch you in
the back, by every magazine an' newspaper&mdash;an'
<i>you</i> know what Mrs. Macy is on bein'
pinched; why, she says she give up belts
an' took to carpet slippers just for the very
reason as she could <i>not</i> stand bein' pinched
nowhere.</p>

<p>"Well, seems as the shoes was Kulosis
shoes an' Mrs. Macy says how any one
could remember 'em off of paper <i>she</i> can't
see anyhow, an' Luther Stott's wife lives
2164 Eleventh Avenue S.W., an' that was
very important too, for there's seven other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Eleventh Avenues in the city besides eight
Eleventh Streets; seems as the new part
of the city is laid out that way so as to
make it simple to them as knows where
they live anyhow.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Macy says she put on her
bonnet as happy as any one looks to be
afore they know they're goin' to be the
first to have a new invention tried on 'em
an' then she locked up her house an' set
off. She says she never was great on new
inventions for she's lived under a lightnin'
rod for pretty near forty years an' never
come anywhere nigh to be struck once yet,
but she says she has now learned to her
sorrow as bein' fooled by a lightnin' rod
man forty years ago ain't nothin' to bein'
fooled by a minister for forty years ahead,
for she says she'll lose her guess if this last
foolin' don't last forty years or even longer
if she lives that long, an' make her wear
her felt slippers all the forty years too.</p>

<p>"Well, she says of course you might
know as it would be the minister as done<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
her up first on this day of misery, an' it
<i>was</i> the minister! She says after that
donation party to fix him out with new
shirts last week she surely looked to be
spared any further inflictions from him
for one while; she says the idea as the
congregation is expected to shirt the minister
was surely most new to her, an' she was
dead set against it at first, but she says
she come to the fore an' was one to help
make him the six when she see as it was
expected to be her duty as a Christian, but
she says she surely hoped when she hemmed
the tail of the last one as she'd seen the
last of him for a good breathin' spell.</p>

<p>"But no, Mrs. Lathrop, seems it was n't
to be, an' so she learned to her keen an'
pinchin' sorrow yesterday mornin', for she
was n't more 'n fairly on her way to town
when she run square up to him on the
bridge an' as a result was just in time to be
the first for him to try his new memory
system on, an' she told Gran'ma Mullins
an' me with tears in her eyes an' her felt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
slippers solemnly crossed on top of each
other, as she can not see why it had to be
her of all people an' her shoes of all things,
for she says&mdash;an' I certainly felt to agree,
Mrs. Lathrop&mdash;as if there's anythin' on
the wide earth as you <i>don't</i> want to apply
a memory system to it's your shoes, for
shoes is somethin' as is happiest forgot.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop, seems as this new
memory system of the minister's is a thing
as he got out of a Sunday School magazine
in reward for workin' out a puzzle. Seems
you guess big cities till their capital letters
spell 'Memory,' an' then you send the
answers to the magazine an' a dollar for
postage an' packin' an' then they send you
the memory system complete in one book
for nothin' a <i>tall</i>. Or you can add in a
two-cent stamp an' not guess nothin', but
the minister guessed 'cause he felt as in
his circumstances he had n't ought to waste
even two cents! Seems as they had a
most awful time afore they found Ypsilanti
for the 'Y,' an' for a while they was most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
afraid they'd have to be reckless with two
cents, but they got it in the end an' sent
'em all off, an' the book come back with a
injunction forbiddin' it to be lent to no one
stamped on every page. Seems it come
back day before yesterday an' the minister
sat up most of the night commemoratin'
the theory, an' then Mrs. Macy says he
just got it into him in time for Fate to let
him go an' be flung at her right on the
bridge! She says she was n't no more
mistrustin' trouble than any one does when
they meet a loose minister out walkin' an'
she says she can't well see how any woman
meetin' a man across a bridge can be
blamed for not knowin' as he's just grasped
a new principle an' is dyin' to apply it to
the first thing handy.</p>

<p>"She says he asked her where she was
goin' an' she told him frank an' open as
she was goin' to the city to buy some shoes
as was warranted not to pinch. She says
he asked her what kind of shoes they was
an' she opened her little bag an' got out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
the paper an' read him as they was Kulosis
shoes. He asked her why she had it wrote
down an' she told him as she had it wrote
down so as not to forget the kind an' maybe
get pinched again.</p>

<p>"Well, she says she was standin' sideways
an' was n't watchin' particular, so
she was n't in no state to suspect nothin'
when he told her as she could easy throw
that piece of paper away an' go to town
without it. She says she told him as she
knowed that she could easy throw the piece
of paper away an' go to town without it,
but how was she to remember her shoes
which was the reason why she was takin'
the piece of paper along with her? Then
she says as he said as he'd show her how
to remember her shoes an' welcome an'
she says as she thought as long as it was
welcome she might as well stand still, so
she did.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop, you can believe me
or not just as you please, but the first thing
he did was to ask her what Kulosis reminded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
her of, which struck her as most strange
in the start out. But she told him as it
did n't remind her of nothin' but shoes an'
let it go at that, an' she says it was plain
as then he had to think of somethin' as it
<i>could</i> remind somebody of, an' she says
he certainly did have to think a long while
an' when he said finally as it reminded <i>him</i>
of four noses.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop, Mrs. Macy says she
never heard the beat of that in all her born
days, an' her mind went back to her childhood
days an' a uncle she had, an' the
Lord 'll surely forgive her for thinkin' as he'd
surely been drinkin'; she says she was so
took aback that he see it in her face an'
told her right then an' there as it was a
memory system. Seems as the key to the
whole is as you must reduce everythin'
to Mother Goose so as not to need the brains
as you've growed since, an' the minister
told Mrs. Macy as she'd find it most simple
to apply. He went on to ask her what did
four noses remind her of, an' she says she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
thought she see the whole game at that
an' told him as quick as scat that they
reminded her of Kulosis, but oh, my,
seems that ain't the way it goes a <i>tall</i>, an'
he begin an' explained it all over again,
an' where he come out in the end was as
four noses would just naturally remind
any one as had more brains'n Mrs. Macy
of 'Two legs sat upon three legs.' You
know the rhyme in Mother Goose where
the dog is four legs an' gets the mutton
as is one leg in the man's lap?</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;Mrs. Macy was just about plum paralyzed at that.&#39;&quot; Page <a href="#Page_179">179</a>.</span>
</div>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop, you can maybe
understand as Mrs. Macy was just about
plum paralyzed at <i>that</i>! Her story is as
she just stood afore him with her mouth
open like a Jack-o'-lantern's, wonderin'
what under the sun she was goin' to be
asked to remember next, an' when he said
that was all, an' for her just to simply tear
up the paper, she forgot all about Luther
Stott's wife on the back an' tore up the
paper. He said for her to go right along
to town fully an' freely relyin' on 'Two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
legs sat upon three legs' to get her her
shoes, an' she says what with bein' so dumbfoundered,
an' what with him bein' the
minister into the bargain, she went along
to the station thinkin' as maybe she'd be
able to do it.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop, I wish you could
hear Mrs. Macy for that ain't nothin' but
the beginnin', whatever you may think,
an' the rest gets awfuller an' awfuller!</p>

<p>"In the first place talkin' so long for
the minister made her have to run for the
train, an' <i>you</i> know what Mrs. Macy is on
a run. She said she got so hot, as she was
not only on a run but mostly on a pour all
the way to town. Why, she says it was
most terrible an' she says nothin' ever give
her such a idea as she was a born fool afore,
for with it all she had to keep on sayin'
'Two legs sat upon three legs' as regular as
a clock, an' she was so afraid she'd forget
it that she did n't dare even take her usual
little nap on the way an' so had no choice
but to land all wore out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, as soon as she was landed she
remembered about Luther Stott's wife bein'
on the back of the piece of paper an' consequently
tore up along with her shoes, an'
she says the start she got over rememberin'
havin' torn up Luther Stott's wife drove
what 'Two legs sat upon three legs' was
to remind her of clean out of her head,
not to speak of havin' long since lost track
of the way to get any connection between
that an' her shoes.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop, I only wish you'd
of been there to hear! She says nobody
ever did afore! She says she went up one
street an' down another like a lost soul,
lookin' for a policeman. She says she
felt she did n't know where to find nothin'.
She could n't look for Luther in the directory
'cause he's long dead an' only his
wife lives there, an' as for her shoes she
was clean beside herself. She says she
was so mad at the minister as she'd have
throwed away her baptism an' her marriage
then an' there just because it was ministers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
as done 'em both to her, if there'd been
anyway to get 'em off. Finally she just
put her pride into her pocket, went into a
shoe store an' asked 'em openly if 'Two
legs sat upon three legs' reminded 'em of
anythin' in the way of shoes. She says
the man looked at her in a way as passed
all belief an' said it reminded him more of
pants than shoes.</p>

<p>"Well, she says she went out into the
street at that an' her heart was too low for
any use; but the end was n't yet, for as she
was wanderin' along who should she meet
but Drusilla Cobb?</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop, you know Drusilla
Cobb! You know what she was afore she
left here, an' Mrs. Macy says ten years ain't
altered her a <i>tall</i>. Whenever Drusilla was
glad to see any one she always had a reason,
an' Mrs. Macy says it speaks loud for how
clean used up she was over her shoes that
she never remembered that way of Drusilla's.
Drusilla never saw no one on the
street unless she had a reason, an' if she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
had a reason it was Heaven help them as
Drusilla saw on the street.</p>

<p>"So now she saw Mrs. Macy an' asked
her right home to lunch with her, an' Mrs.
Macy very gladly went. She says no words
can tell how lively an' pleasant Drusilla
was, an' she felt to be glad she met her all
the way home. She says Drusilla has a
very nice home an' a thin husband an' three
very thin boys. She says Drusilla is the
only fat one in the family."</p>

<p>Susan paused and drew a long breath.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lathrop adjusted herself in a new
position.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop, now's where the
duck comes in. The duck was Drusilla's
reason, an' Mrs. Macy's next trial. Mrs.
Macy says if any one had told her as she
was to go to town for shoes an' bring back
a duck, or be did in one day first by the
minister an' next by Drusilla Cobb, she'd
take her Bible oath as whoever said it was
lyin', but so it was."</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Miss Clegg, "it's the same
one. An' this is its why as told by Mrs.
Macy to Gran'ma Mullins an' me." She
paused and drew a still longer breath.
"Seems, Mrs. Lathrop, as Drusilla's husband
had got a friend as goes huntin' with
a doctor. Seems he found four little red-headed
things in a nest of reeds an' took
one an' asked the doctor what it was.
Seems the doctor said as he thought as
it was a golden-headed oriole but the
friend thought as it was a mud hen. So
he give it to Drusilla's youngest boy to
raise in a flat for his birthday. Well, Mrs.
Macy says bein' raised in a flat was surely
most new to the animal as very soon turned
out to be a duck. Seems it snapped at all
the black spots in the carpets for bugs an'
when they put it in the bath-tub to swim
it would n't swim but just kept diving for
the hole in the bottom. Seems they had
a most lively time with it an' it run after
'em everywhere an' snapped at their shoe-buttons
an' squawked nights, an' when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Drusilla see Mrs. Macy she thought right
off as she could give her the duck to take
home with her 'cause she lived in the
country. So that was how Mrs. Macy
come to be asked to take dinner at Drusilla's
so dreadful pleasant.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop, Mrs. Macy says as
she no more mistrusted what travelin' with
a duck is than anythin', so although she
could n't say as she really relishes any
duck afore he's cooked, she thought as it
could swim in the crick, an' maybe grow
to be a comfort, so she let them put it in a
basket, an' give her a envelope of dead
flies for it to lunch on, an' she set off for
home. She had to wait a long time for a
car an' the duck was so restless it eat eight
flies an' bit her twice waitin', but finally
the car come along an' she an' the duck
got on. Well, Mrs. Lathrop, she says you
never hear nothin' like that duck when it
felt itself on a electric car! The conductor
heard it an' come runnin' an' stopped the
car an' put 'em both off afore she realized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
as she was gettin' off for her duck instead
of her depot.</p>

<p>"So there was Mrs. Macy stranded high
an' dry in a strange part of the city alone
with a duck out of the goodness of her heart.
You can maybe believe as she was very far
from feelin' friendly to Drusilla Cobb when
she realized as she couldn't take no car
with no duck an' didn't know Drusilla's
number to take her back her duck, neither.
Mrs. Macy says as she felt herself slowly
growin' mad an' she went into a store near
by an' asked 'em if they had a telephone.
They said they had, an' she says she never
will know what possessed her but she just
looked that telephone square in the eye an'
told it to get her the president of the car
company without a second's delay. She
says it was astonishin' how quick it got her
somebody an' as soon as they'd each said
'Hello' polite enough, she just up an' asked
him to please tell her the difference between
a duck an' a canary-bird. Well, she says
he did n't say nothin' for a minute an'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
then he said 'Wh-a-t?' in a most feeble
manner, an' she asked him it right over
again. Then she said he was more nervous
an' made very queer noises an' finally asked
her what in Noah's ark she wanted to know
for. She says she could n't but think that
very ill-bred, considerin' her age, but she
was in a situation where she had to overlook
anythin', so she told him as she knowed
an' he knowed, too, as any one could take
a canary-bird an' travel anywhere an'
never know what it was to be put off for
nothin'. She said he shook the wire a
little more an' then asked her if she was
meanin' to lead him to infer that she had
been injected from a car with a duck. She
says his tone was so disrespectful that she
felt her own beginnin' to rise an' she told him
so far from bein' injected she'd been put out
an' off a car an' she had the duck right with
her to prove it. He told her as he would advise
her to try to do the duck up in a derby
hat an' smuggle him through that way, an'
then without a word more he hung up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Macy says she just about
never was so mad afore. She says when
she turned around all the men in the store
was laughin' an' that made her madder yet,
but there was one on 'em as said he felt
for her 'cause he owned a pair of ducks
himself, an' he went in the back of the
store an' found a old hat-box as was pretty
large an' he went to work an' took the
duck out of the basket an' put him into
the box an' give Mrs. Macy 'em both to
carry an' put her on another car an' she
set off again.</p>

<p>"Well, that time she got to the depot
all safe, an' if there was n't old Dr. Carter
from Meadville an' it goes without sayin'
as old Dr. Carter from Meadville could
drive any duck clean out of Mrs. Macy's
head, so she an' he set out to be real happy
to the Junction, an' the first thing he
asked her was if she'd been buyin' a new
bonnet in town an' she laughed an' give
the box a little heave an' the bottom come
out an' the duck flew down the car.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 440px;"><a name="gs04" id="gs04"></a>

<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;The bottom come out an&#39; the duck flew down the car.&#39;&quot; Page <a href="#Page_188">188</a>.</span>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop, you can maybe
guess as that was most tryin' both to Mrs.
Macy an' Dr. Carter as well, as is both fat an'
was both wedged in one seat expectin' to enjoy
all they could of each other to the Junction.
Dr. Carter was obliged to unwedge
himself an' catchin' the duck was a most
awful business an' Dr. Carter had to get off
just about as soon as it was done. Well,
Mrs. Macy says helpin' to catch your duck
seems to make every one feel as free as air,
an' a man come right off an' sat with her
right off an' asked her right off whether it
was a duck or a drake. Why, she says she
never did&mdash;not in all her life&mdash;an' he told
her she could easy tell by catchin' a spider
an' givin' it to the duck an' if he took it it
was a drake an' if she took it it was a duck.
He asked her if it was n't so an' she said
she could n't deny it, an' then he went
back to his own seat an' she rode the rest
of the way tryin' to figure on where the
hitch was in what he said, for she says as
she certainly feels there's a hitch an' yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
you can't deny that it's all straight about
the spider an' the he and the she.</p>

<p>"Well, so she got home an' went right
up to her house, put the duck in the rat
trap, an' went over to ask the minister
about her shoes, an' what do you think,
Mrs. Lathrop, what do you think! The
minister had clean forgot himself! He
was sittin' there on his piazza advisin' Mrs.
Brown to make her pound-cake by sayin'
'One, two, three, Mother caught a flea,'
the flea bein' the butter, an' Mrs. Macy
says it was plain to be seen as he was n't
a bit pleased at her comin' in that way to
have his memory system applied to her
backward.</p>

<p>"She says after that she went home to
the duck madder 'n ever an' put on her
felt slippers an' made up her mind as she'd
make up for her lost day by rippin' up her
old carpets, an' that was the crownin'
pyramid in her Egyptian darkness, for it's
the carpet as has ended her."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;" exclaimed Mrs. Lathrop.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, she's alive," said Susan, "but she
ain't much more 'n alive, an' it's a wonder
that she's that, an' it would be very bad
for her if she was n't, for young Dr. Brown
says she can die fifty times before he'll
ever go near her again. He's awful mad
an' he's got a bad bump on his nose too
where he fell over her, an' Mrs. Sweet's
got to stay in bed three days too for her
arm where she dislocated it jerkin'&mdash;although
goodness knows what she tried
jerkin' for&mdash;for I'd as soon think of
tryin' to jerk a elephant from under a
whale as to try to jerk Mrs. Macy from
under a carpet. An' even with it all they
could n't get her up an' had to get the
blacksmith's crowbar an' pry, an' Mrs.
Sweet says if any one doubts as pryin' is
painful they'd ought to of been there to
hear Mrs. Macy an' see Hiram an' the
blacksmith."</p>

<p>"But what&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to tell you if you'll just keep
still a little longer an' let me get through to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the end," said her friend. "I got this part
all back an' forth an' upside down from
Mrs. Sweet while I was takin' her home by
the other arm. Oh, my, but it's awful
about her, for she was preservin' an' wanted
a extra cullender an' lost her right arm in
consequence. I hope her experience 'll be
a lesson to you, Mrs. Lathrop, for it's
been such a lesson to me that I may mention
right here an' now 't if I ever hear you
hollerin' I shall put for the opposite direction
as quick as I can for I would n't never
take no chances at gettin' dislocated like
Mrs. Sweet is&mdash;not if I knew it. Young
Dr. Brown says she's decapitated the
angular connection between her collar bone
an' somewhere else, an' she says she can
well believe it judgin' from the way her
ear keeps shootin' into her wrist an' back
again."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" interrupted Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop, you know how Mrs.
Macy always was forever given to economizin'.
I don't say as economizin' is any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
sin, but I will say as Mrs. Macy's ways of
economizin' is sometimes most singular an'
to-day's a example of that. Economy's all
right as long as you economize out of yourself,
but when it takes in Mrs. Sweet an'
bumps young Dr. Brown I've no patience&mdash;no
more 'n Mrs. Sweet an' young Dr.
Brown has. Young Dr. Brown says it
looks awful to have a black eye an' no
reason for it except fallin' over a carpet.
He says when he explains as Mrs. Macy
was under the carpet no one is goin' to
think it any thin' but funny, an' he says a
doctor must n't be hurt funny ways. Mrs.
Sweet don't feel to blame herself none for
her arm 'cause she jerked like she does
everythin' else, with her whole heart, an'
she says she did so want to set her up that
she tried harder an' harder every jerk.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop, to go 'way back to
the beginnin', seems as Mrs. Macy set out
last night, as I said before, to make over
her carpet. Seems as she wanted to turn
it all around so's it'd fade away under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
stove an' fray out in the corner where it
don't show. I don't say as the idea was n't
a good one&mdash;although it's come pretty
hard on Mrs. Sweet&mdash;but anyhow, good
or no good, she dug up the tacks last night
an' ripped the widths an' set down to sew
this mornin'. Her story is as she turned
the duck out to pasture right after breakfast
an' then went to work an' sewed away
as happy as a bean until about ten o'clock.
Then she felt most awful tired from the
rippin' an' yesterday an' all, so she thought
she'd rest a little. Seems as her legs was
all done up in the carpet an' gettin' out
was hard so she thought she'd just lay
back on the floor. Seems she lay back
suddener than she really intended an' as
she hit the floor, she was <i>took</i>.</p>

<p>"She give a yell an' she says she kept
on givin' yells for one solid hour, an' no
one come. She says as no words can ever
tell how awful it was, for every yell sent
a pain like barbed wire lightnin' forkin'
an' knifin' all ways through her. No one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
heard her, for the blacksmith was shoein'
a mule on one side of her an' Gran'ma
Mullins an' Lucy was discussin' Hiram on
the other. You know what a mule is to
shoe, Mrs. Lathrop, an' you know what
Gran'ma Mullins an' Lucy is when they take
to discussin' Hiram. I'll take my Bible oath
as when Gran'ma Mullins an' Lucy gets to
discussin' Hiram they couldn't hear no
steam penelope out of a circus, not if it
was settin' full tilt right on their very own
door-mat. So poor Mrs. Macy laid there
an' hollered till Mrs. Sweet came for the
cullender.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Sweet says, <i>the</i> shock she got when
she opened the door an' see Mrs. Macy with
the carpet on her was enough to upset
anybody.</p>

<p>"She says she thought at first as Mrs.
Macy was tryin' to take up her carpet by
crawlin' under it an' makin' the tacks
come out that way. But then she see as
her face was up an' of course no Christian'd
ever crawl under no carpet with her face<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
up. So she asked her what was the matter,
an' Mrs. Macy told her frank an' open as she
did n't know what was the matter. Then
Mrs. Sweet went to work an' tried to set her
up. An' she says the way she yelled!</p>

<p>"She says she jerked her by the arms,
an' by the legs, an' even by the head, an'
her howls only grew awfuler an' awfuler.
Mrs. Macy says as her agonies was terrible
every time she slid a little along, an' she
just begged an' prayed for her to go an'
get young Dr. Brown. So finally Mrs.
Sweet ran next door an' separated Lucy
an' Gran'ma Mullins an' Lucy went for
young Dr. Brown an' Gran'ma Mullins an'
Mrs. Sweet went for Mrs. Macy. Oh, my,
but their story is as they jerked hard then,
for they wanted her to be respectable in
bed afore he came, but it was no use an'
he bounced in an' fell over Mrs. Macy an'
the carpet afore his eyes got used to where
he was. They had to help him up an'
then he had to go in the kitchen an' disinfect
his bump afore he could take a look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
at Mrs. Macy. But seems he got around to
her at last an' felt her pulse an' then as
he'd forgot his kinetoscope he just pounded
her softly all over with the tack-hammer,
but he did n't find out nothin' that way for
she yelled wherever he hit her. He said
then as he'd like to turn X-rays through
her, only as there is n't no cellar under
her house just there there'd be no way to
get a picture of the other side of what was
the matter with her.</p>

<p>"So he said she <i>must</i> be got up, an'
although she howled as she could n't be,
he had Lucy an' Hiram an' the blacksmith's
crowbar an' the blacksmith, an'
it was plain as she'd have to come whether
nor no. Mrs. Sweet says it was surely a
sight to see. They put the crowbar across
a footstool, an' Hiram jerked on the other
side at the same time, an' with a yell like
Judgment Day they sat her up.</p>

<p>"An' what do you think, Mrs. Lathrop?
What <i>do</i> you think? There was a tack
stickin' square in the middle of her back!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, my, but young Dr. Brown was
awful mad! Mr. Kimball says he guesses
he's got suthin' out of somebody now as
he won't care to preserve in alcohol for a
ornament to his mantelpiece. Hiram is
mad, too, for he was goin' over to Meadville
to fan a baseball team this afternoon
an' he says Mrs. Macy has used up all his
fannin' muscle. An' Lucy's mad 'cause
she says she was way ahead of Gran'ma
Mullins in what they were talkin' about
an' now she's forgotten what that was.
But Gran'ma Mullins was maddest of all
when she found out about the duck, 'cause
it seems as Drusilla Cobb's husband was
a relation of hers an' as a consequence
she never could bear Drusilla, so I said I'd
take the duck."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"I shall fat him an' eat him."</p>

<p>"An' what&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop,
further.</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot to tell you that: Mrs.
Macy hunted up the magazine an' looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
'em up an' for a fact it was Kulosis after
all. As soon as she see it she remembered
the four noses an' all, but she says she was
too done up to go any further at the
minister just then."</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop, finally.</p>

<p>"I don't know, an' I don't care anyhow,
an' I ain't goin' to catch no spider for the
sake of findin' out. He'll eat just as well
as she will, I reckon, an' if I have any
doubts, my ways of settlin' 'em 'll be by
parboilin' instead of spiders."</p>

<p>So saying Susan rose, sought her duck,
and departed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="center">MONOTONY OF MINISTERIAL MONOLOGUES</p>


<p>Mrs. Lathrop never went to church.
She had relinquished church when
she had given up all other social joys that
called for motive power beyond the limits
of her own fence.</p>

<p>Elijah rarely ever went to church. The
getting the paper out Friday for Saturday
delivery wore on him so that he nearly
always slept until noon on Sunday.</p>

<p>So Susan went alone week after week,
just as she had been going alone for years
and years and years. She always wore a
black dress to church, her mother's cashmere
shawl, and a bonnet of peculiar shape
which had no strings and fitted closely
around her head. She always took about
an hour and a half to get home from church,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
although it was barely ten minutes' walk,
and she always went in Mrs. Lathrop's
gate instead of her own when she did get
home. Mrs. Lathrop knew almost to the
minute when to expect her and was invariably
seated ready and waiting.</p>

<p>One late May day when Susan returned
from church she followed her usual course
of Sunday observances by going straight to
her neighbor's and sitting down hard on
one of the latter's kitchen chairs, but she
differed from her usual course by her expression,
which&mdash;usually bland and fairly
contented with the world in general&mdash;was
this morning most bitterly set and firmly
assured in displeasure.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Lathrop, somewhat
alarmed but attempting to speak pleasantly,
"was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," said Susan, "I should say not."
Then she unpinned her hat and ran the
pin through the crown with a vicious
directness that bore out her words to the
full.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Susan!" said Mrs. Lathrop, appalled,
"why&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't help it if you are," said
Miss Clegg, "you don't have to go Sunday
after Sunday an' listen like I do. If you
did, an' if you had what you ain't got an'
that's some spirit, Mrs. Lathrop, you'd be
rammin' around with a hat-pin yourself
an' understand my feelin's when I say as
there ain't a spot in the Bible as I ain't
been over fully as often as the minister nor
a place where he can open it that I can't
tell just what he'll say about it afore he's
done settlin' his tie an' clearin' his throat.
I'm so tired of that tie-settlin' an' throat-clearin'
business I don't know what to do
an' then to-day it was the Sermon on the
Mount an' he said as he had a new thought
to develop out of the mount for us an' the
new thought was as life was a mount with
us all climbin' up it an' sure to come out
on top with the Sermon if our legs held out.
It's this new idea of new thoughts as he's
got hold of as puts me so out of all patience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
I don't know what to do; if they was
really new I'd revel to listen to 'em, but
they're as old as the hills an' I feel like I
was offered somethin' to cut my teeth on
whenever I hear him beginnin' with a
fresh old one. The other day I met him
down in the square an' he stopped me short
an' told me to my face as the world was
gettin' full o' new thoughts, an' that a star
as he see the night afore had given him
one as he was intendin' to work up for
Christmas. Well, Mrs. Lathrop, what do
you think that particular new thought
was? What <i>do</i> you think? It was as
God was back o' the stars! My lands, I
felt like givin' him a punch with my parasol
an' I'd of done it too only I'd left my
parasol at home an' had n't nothin' with
me but a basket o' currants. I told him
though as the idea o' God an' the stars
bein' anyways new was surely <i>most</i> new to
me, an' then I went on to say as Rachel
Rebecca had said she'd come an' pick
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>berries for me Monday an' seein' as Tuesday
was lettin' its sun down pretty fast I
could only hope as some other new thought
had n't run off with her, too.</p>

<p>"It's this way, Mrs. Lathrop, I don't
get much fun out o' church anyway, for
I'm on red-hot porcupines the whole time
I'm there thinkin' what I could be doin'
at home if I <i>was</i> at home, an' wonderin'
whether Elijah is in bed or whether he's
up an' about. I don't know a more awful
feelin' than the feelin' that you're chained
helpless in a church while the man in your
house is up an' about your house. Men
were n't meant to be about houses an' I
always liked father because he never was
about, but Elijah is of a inquirin' disposition
an' he inquires more Sundays than
any other time. The idea as he's wanderin'
around just carelessly lookin' into everythin'
as ain't locked upsets me for listenin'
to the minister anyway, but lately my
patience has been up on its hind legs in
church clawin' an' yowlin' more 'n ever,
for it seems as if the minister gets tamer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
an' tamer faster an' faster as time rolls on,
an' between not likin' to hear him an' bein'
half mad to get back to Elijah I'm beginnin'
to wish as God in His infinite mercy had
let me be somethin' besides a Christian. I
don't know what I'd be if I was n't a
Christian, but my own view o' this idea o'
free-trade in religion as is takin' so many
folks nowadays is as it all comes from most
anybody with common sense jus' naturally
knowin' more than any minister as always
has his house an' his potatoes for nothin'
ever can possibly get a chance to learn;
an' when folks realize as they know more
than the minister they ain't apt to like
to waste the time as they might be learnin'
more yet, sittin' an' listenin' to him tag
along behind what they know already. A
minister is kind o' like a horse in blinders
or a cow as wears a yoke to keep her from
jumpin', anyway&mdash;he feels as he can't
launch out even if he wants to an' so he
never does, but my idea would be to give
'em a little rope an' let 'em be a little more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
interestin'. Here's two hours a week as
we sit still an' might be learnin' things
much more useful than as Job was patient
an' Joseph was n't. I'm tired of Job an'
Joseph anyhow. I've heard about 'em both
ever since I was old enough to know about
either, an' long afore I was old enough to
know about Joseph. I was talkin' about
this at the sewin' society yesterday an'
they all agreed with me. Mrs. Macy said
as her feelin' was as she'd been wantin'
to go to sleep in church for the last five
years, an' she was beginnin' to have it so
strong as she did n't care who knowed it.</p>

<p>"Was the minister's&mdash;" asked Mrs.
Lathrop, with vivid curiosity.</p>

<p>"No, 'cause Brunhilde Susan thought a
moth ball was a lemon drop an' dealt with
it a'cordin', an' she was too used up by
the bein' up all night to even so much as
overcast a plain seam; but the rest was
there an' we all aired ourselves inside out,
I can assure you, an' was more 'n glad as
she was n't there, so we could do it, too.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>"The general talk was as the minister 'd
do well to quit talkin' about Heaven for a
while an' come down to earth. We all
know about Heaven, 'cause if you don't all
you have to do is to tip back your head an'
there it is day an' night for you to look at as
long as your neck don't ache, but what
we don't know about is a lot of what's
right around us. Mrs. Macy says as her
view would be to take the Bible for the
motto an' then apply it right to us here
to-day, an' tell us how to understand what's
goin' on in the world by its light. She
says David an' Goliath could of been Japan
an' Russia with Admiral Togo for the sling
shot, an' we all felt to agree as <i>there</i> was a
idea as <i>no</i> minister ought to mind ownin',
for Mrs. Sweet told me comin' home as she
never would of give Mrs. Macy credit for
thinkin' nothin' out so closely as that.
Every one was interested right off an' you
ought to of been there to see how the idea
took! Gran'ma Mullins said as she'd <i>always</i>
wanted to know what a soft-nosed bullet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
looked like an' how their other features felt,
an' a sermon like that could n't but give us
all a new understandin' of a war. Then
they all got to thinkin' out the thing, an'
Mrs. Sweet said as Jezabel bein' throwed to
the dogs could apply to that new rule in
the city as makes you have to go around
with your dog's nose in a lattice an' yourself
tied to the dog; she said when she
went up there the other day she felt like
nothin' but a fool out with her brother an'
him bein' jerked here an' there a'cordin'
as the dog's feelin's moved him, an' the
dog's lattice half the time over one of his
two ears so he looked more drunk than
sober all day. Of course we ain't got no
such rules about dogs' noses here, but no
one set down on Mrs. Sweet, because it
showed she took an interest; Mrs. Brown
said when she was done as she should think
as the sun standin' still on Absalom three
days could be worked up into havin' our
streets lit all night, for she says when
young Dr. Brown is out late, Amelia's so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
awful nervous she has to sit by her an'
hold her hand, an' young Dr. Brown always
says it takes him a good hour longer than
it ought to gettin' home, on a'count o'
bein' so afraid o' runnin' into trees in the
dark."</p>

<p>"They say&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you could n't make his mother
believe it," said Susan; "she thinks he
eats peppermint comin' home nights just
because he likes to eat peppermint comin'
home nights. Mothers is all like that.
You know yourself how you was with
Jathrop. That'd make another nice talk,
about how all sons was n't prodigals, some
bein' obliged by fate to be the calf instead.
I must say, Mrs. Lathrop, as the more I
think of this new idea the more took I am
with it. The Bible would be most like a
new book if we took it that way an' Sunday
would be a day to look forward to all the
week long, just to see what the minister
was goin' to say about what next. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
sewin' society was all in favor of the idea
an' now if the square only takes it up with
a real mother's heart I don't see why we
should n't get some profit out o' keepin'
a minister yet. My notion is as the minister
might just as well learn to be a lesson
to us as to be so dead satisfied with only
bein' a trial to us. We've got trials
enough, Lord knows, an' just now what
with the weather an' the cleanin' house no
one wants to go to church to hear about
things as they all know anyhow."</p>

<p>"I wonder&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"No, I would n't look for that," said
Susan; "every one has their limits an' I
would n't expect no man to jump over
his own outside. I should n't ever look for
the minister to be really equal to workin'
up somethin' real spicy as would fill the
house out o' Uriah the Hittite or Abigail
hangin' upside down to the tree, but I
can't well see why he could n't teach us
whether well water's healthy or not by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
quotin' from Rebecca, an' when the time
comes he could surely get a real nice
Thanksgivin' text out o' John the Baptist's
head on the platter."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop, slowly.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' home to Elijah now," said
Susan, "an' I shall talk the matter up with
him. Elijah's awful funny, Mrs. Lathrop.
However much he roams around while
I'm in church he always hops back in bed
an' manages to be sound asleep when it's
time for me to come home. An' I will say
this for him, an' that is as with all his
pryin' an' meddlin' he's clever enough to get
things back so I can never see no traces of
what he's been at. If I was n't no sharper
than most others, I'd think as he never
had stirred out of bed while I was gone&mdash;but
I am sharper than others an' it'll take
a sharper young man than Elijah to make
me suppose as all is gold that glitters or
that a man left all alone in a house don't
take that time to find out what he's alone
in the midst of."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ADVISABILITY OF NEWSPAPER EXPOSURES</p>


<p>"Well, I don't know I'm sure what I
<i>am</i> goin' to do with Elijah," said
Susan Clegg to her friend one evening.
"He's just as restless in his ideas as he
is in bed, an' he's not content in bed without
untuckin' everythin' at the foot. I
hate a bed as is kicked out at the foot an'
I hate a man as makes a woman have to
put the whole bed together again new
every mornin'. I'm sure I don't see no
good to come of kickin' nights an' I've
talked to Elijah about layin' still till I
should think he could n't but see how right
I am an' how wrong he is, but still he goes
right on kickin', an' now he's got it into
his head as he's got to turn the town topsy-turvy
by findin' out suthin' wrong as we'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
rather not know, an' makin' us very uncomfortable
by knowin' it, an' knowin' as
now we know it we've got to do suthin'
about it, an' that seems to make him kick
more than ever."</p>

<p>"Dear&mdash;" ejaculated Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"He set on the porch for an hour with
me last night," Susan went on, "tryin' to
think o' suthin' as he could expose in the
paper. He says a paper ain't nothin'
nowadays without it's exposin' suthin,
an' a town ain't fit to have a paper if it
ain't got nothin' to expose in it. He says
no closet without some skeleton, an' he
should think we'd have ours, an' in the end
he talked so much that I could n't but
feel for a little as maybe he was right an' as
we <i>was</i> behind the times, for when you
come to think it over, Mrs. Lathrop, nothin'
ever does happen here as had n't ought to
happen&mdash;not since Mr. Shores' wife run
off with his clerk, an' that wa'n't no great
happenin', for they could n't stand sittin'
on the piazza much longer&mdash;every one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
could see that&mdash;an' Mrs. Shores wasn't
one to have any man but her own husband
comin' in an' out o' the house at all hours,
an' so if she'd got to the point where she
wanted a man as wasn't her own husband
comin' in an' out, she just had to up an'
run away with him, an' I never have been
one to say no ill of her, for I look on Mr.
Shores with a cool an' even eye, an' lookin'
on Mr. Shores with a cool an' even eye
leads me to fully an' freely approve of
every thin' as his wife ever done."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it, an' that's why I speak
as I do. But Elijah seems to think as
suthin' else ought to of happened since then,
an' he asked me if I didn't know of nothin'
as was bein' tried to be covered up as he
could uncover, an' I really did try to think
of suthin' but nobody ever covers up
nothin' here. Nobody could if they wanted
to. Everybody knows everythin' about
everybody. We all know about Lucy an'
Hiram, 'cause Gran'ma Mullins is always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
tellin' her side an' Hiram's side, an' Lucy
is always tellin' her side an' Hiram's other
side. Gran'ma Mullins says when she sees
a man like Hiram havin' to devote his
strength an' his Sundays to catchin' water-bugs,
she most feels she's been a mother
in vain, an' Lucy says when she realizes
as she's married a man as can't be put to
no better use Sundays than catchin' water-bugs,
she ain't got no doubt at all as to
what she's married. Lucy's gettin' very
bitter about marriage; she says when she
thinks as she may be picked out for a
golden weddin' she feels like tyin' balloons
to her feet an' goin' out an' standin' on
her head in the crick. Elijah asked me
if maybe she was n't in love with some one
else as he could just notice in general kind
o' terms, but I told him he did n't know
what Lucy Dill was on men now as Hiram
has got her eyes open. Why, Lucy don't
believe no more in love a <i>tall</i>. Lucy says
if she was rid of men an' left on a desert
island alone, with one cow, so she could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
have eggs an' milk toast regular, she'd
never watch for no ship, an' if a ship heaved
up anywhere near, she'd heave down so
quick that if any one on the ship had seen
her they'd think they imagined her afore
they'd get ready to go to her rescue.
Elijah shook his head then, an' trailed off
to Polly Allen; he said there must be thirty-five
years between Polly an' the deacon,
an' could n't suthin' be hinted at about
them. That set me to wonderin', an' it's
really very strange when you come to
think of it, Mrs. Lathrop, how contented
Polly is. I don't believe they've ever had
a word. He does the cookin' an' washin'
the same as he always did, an' lets her do
anythin' else she pleases, an' they say she's
always very obligin' about doin' it.</p>

<p>"So then Elijah crossed his legs the other
way, an' asked if there was n't anythin'
bigger as could be looked into, but every
one knows Hiram is the biggest man anywhere
around here, so that was no use.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>He asked then if we did n't have a poorhouse
or a insane asylum or a slaughter-house
or suthin' as he could show up in
red ink. He said somebody must be doin'
suthin' as they had n't ought to be doin'
somewhere, an' it was both his virtue an'
his business to print all about it. He says
exposin' is the very life o' the newspaper
business, an' you can't be nothin' nowadays
without you expose. He seemed to
feel very much put out about us not bein'
able to be exposed, an' I could n't help
a kind o' hurt feelin' as it was really so.</p>

<p>"But what can I do, Mrs. Lathrop, I
did n't know of nothin'? We ain't got no
place to do anythin' except in the square
an' nobody never does nothin' without
everybody knows that day or the next
mornin' at the latest. I don't believe as
anybody could have a secret with anybody
in this town 'cause you'd know very well
as if you did n't get 'round pretty quick
an' tell it first the other one would be
gettin' ahead o' you an' tellin' it before
you. Of course I could see Elijah's drift<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
all right. Them city papers has turned
his head completely just as they do everybody
else's when they first get a new idea.
Elijah wants us to be eatin' bluing for blueberries
an' cats for calves jus' so he can be
the first to tell us about it, but there ain't
a cat in town as ain't too well known for
anybody to eat without knowin' it, an' as
for bluing, if anybody can feed it to me
for blueberries it's me as is the fool an'
them as is n't, an' that's my views.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is, Mrs. Lathrop, I
ain't got no great sympathy with this new
idea o' keepin' us all stirred up over how
awful things is. I won't say as I approved
when that man in Chicago made sausage
out o' his wife 'cause he was tired o' her,
but I will say as if Lucy see her chance at
Hiram that way I ain't sure as she could
restrain herself. Hiram's perfectly healthy
an' could be depended upon not to disagree
with no one in sausage to anythin' like the
extent Lucy disagrees with him, an' Gran'ma
Mullins is so tired of hearin' 'em quarrel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
that I ain't prepared to say as she'd rebel
at anythin' as sent Lucy back to her
father.</p>

<p>"Elijah went on to tell me a lot about
insurance an' railroads, but all about insurance
an' railroads is 'way beyond my
interest an' 'way beyond the understandin'
of every one else here, an' nobody's goin'
to remember a thing about any of it a year
from now anyhow. That's the trouble
with this country,&mdash;they don't remember
nothin',&mdash;everybody forgets everythin' before
the month is out. Most of the people
never thinks o' San Francisco now, an' as
for that fire they had in Baltimore, it's as
dead as Moses.</p>

<p>"That's the advantage the rest of the
country has over us when it comes to
exposin'. They can expose an' expose,
an' all the folks who read about it forget
an' forget, but here in this community it's
different an' you can't count on <i>our</i> forgettin'
things a <i>tall</i>, an' if Elijah was
turned loose I'll venture to say every last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
one o' them papers would be saved until
doomsday. I know that an' knowin' that
I very carefully restrain him. There's a
many as knows as Mr. Kimball's dried apples
is often very under rate, an' a many others
as knows whose dead cat that was as Mrs.
Sweet had to bury after vowin' she would n't
till she smelt as she'd got to. Every last
one of us knows what Dr. Brown gets at
the drug store when he asks for what he
usually gets an' there's a good many as
thinks as Mrs. Macy goes to Meadville
more on a'count o' Dr. Carter than to see
her cousin, Mrs. Lupey. But I was n't
goin' to set Elijah swimmin' in any such
deep water. Elijah is a young man an'
the age to go wrong easy, an' when that
age see how easy it is to go wrong they're
nothin' but foolish if they waste another
second goin' right, so if Elijah wants to go
to exposin' he'll have to get his stuff from
some one else beside me."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"No, I don't say that," said Miss Clegg,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
"I'm only human after all an' I can't in
conscience deny as I should like to see
them as I don't like showed up just as
much as any other man as is makin' a
business of showin' up his neighbors, likes
it. But I know I've got to live here an'
it'd be very poor livin' for me after I'd
aired myself by way of Elijah. There's a
great difference between knowin' things
all by yourself an' readin' 'em in the paper,
an' I know as that dead cat would cause a
great deal o' hard feelin' in print, while
buried by Mrs. Sweet it only helps her
garden grow. So I shall keep on talkin'
as usual, but I shall hold Elijah out o'
print an' so keep the country safe."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Oh, the paper'll do just as well," said
Susan; "he's goin' to print one sheet as
comes all printed from the city every week
an' he says that'll put new zest in the thing.
It'll be a great deal better to get the zest
that way than to get it exposin'. Zest is
suthin' as is always safest a good ways off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Elijah saw that, too, afore he got done
last night, for in his hitchin' about he
hitched over the edge o' the piazza in the
end."</p>

<p>"Did&mdash;" cried Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Well, no," said Miss Clegg. "But he
tore a lot of things an' smashed a rose
bush, but I did n't care about that. I
just told him to leave 'em on a chair this
mornin' an' I'd sew 'em all up again,
an' I done it, an' as to the rose bush, I'll
have him get another an' give it to me for
a present the next time I go to the city to
pick it out myself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="center">THE TRIAL OF A SICK MAN IN THE HOUSE</p>


<p>"Well, where&mdash;" began Mrs. Lathrop
in a tone of real pleasure at
seeing Miss Clegg come into her kitchen
one afternoon a few days after.</p>

<p>Miss Clegg dropped into a chair.</p>

<p>"Well, I <i>have</i> got trouble now!" she
announced abruptly, "Elijah's sick!"</p>

<p>"Eli&mdash;" cried Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"&mdash;Jah," finished Susan. "Yes, Mrs.
Lathrop, Elijah's sick! He was sick all
night an' all this mornin', an' I may in confidence
remark as I hope this'll be a lesson
to him to never do it again, for I've got
a feelin' in my legs as 'll bear me out in
lettin' him or any one else die afore I'll
ever work again like I've worked to-day
an' last night."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did n't you see young Dr. Brown?"</p>

<p>"No, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I supposed so," said Susan, resignedly;
"I know your ways, Mrs. Lathrop,
an' I never look for any other ways in you.
It's good as I don't, for if I did I'd be blind
from lookin' an' not seein'. I know you,
Mrs. Lathrop, an' I know your ways, an'
I realize to the full how different they are
from me an' my ways, but a friend is a
friend an' what can't be endured has got
to be cured, so I come to tell you about
Elijah just the same as I do anythin' else
as is easy heard."</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"No, he is n't. That is, he was n't when
I come out, but he had his pen an' said he
was goin' to write a editorial sittin' up in
bed. He can't get out of bed on a'count
of the sheet, but 'Liza Em'ly's there if he
wants anythin' so it don't matter if I do
leave for a little while. She come an'
offered an' I don't see why she should n't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
have a chance to get married the same as
any other girl, so I set her in the next room
an' told her not to go near him on no
a'count, an' naturally there ain't nothin'
as'll make 'em wilder to talk than for
Elijah to feel he'd ought to be workin' on
his editorial an' for 'Liza Em'ly to feel as
he had n't ought to be spoke to. I don't
say as I consider Elijah any great catch,
but if 'Liza Em'ly can find any joy jumpin'
at him with her mouth open I ain't one to
deprive her of the hop. Elijah's a very
fair young man as young men go, an' I
think any girl as is willin' to do her nine-tenths
can have a time tryin' to be happy
with him. If she ain't happy long it won't
be Elijah's fault for he's just as sure his
wife 'll be happy as any other man is."</p>

<p>"But about&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what I come to tell you.
He woke me last night, tappin' on my
door, an' hollered as he had the appendicitis
on both sides at once."</p>

<p>"On both&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's what he said. Well, as soon
as I got awake enough to know as I was n't
asleep, I knowed he was wrong somehow
an' I sat up in bed an' hollered back to
him to take ten sips o' water, hold his
breath while he counted fifteen, an' go
back to bed. I was n't calculatin' to get
up with no two-sided appendicitis in the
middle o' no night if I could help it, an' I
knowed anyhow as it was only some of
them dried apples o' Mr. Kimball's as was
maybe lodged here an' there in him an'
no harm done if he'd only let me sleep.</p>

<p>"But, no sir, Elijah had no idea o'
lettin' me sleep while he set up alone with
his own two sides. There's suthin' about
a man, Mrs. Lathrop, as 'll never let him
suffer in silence if there's any woman to
be woke up. A man can't be a hero unless
a woman stands by barefooted with a
candle, an' he feels a good deal easier
groanin' if he can hear her sneezin' between
times. So back come Elijah right off to
say as I must be up an' doin' or he'd be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
dead afore dawn. I was so sound asleep
I told him to set a mouse trap two times
afore my senses come to me an' then when
they did I was mad. I tell you I was <i>good</i>
an' mad too. I put on my slippers an'
father's duster as I always keep hangin'
to my bedpost to slip on or dust with just
as I feel to need it on or dustin', an' I went
to Elijah. He was back layin' in bed done
up in a sort o' ring o' rosy, groanin' an'
takin' on an' openin' an' shuttin' his eyes
like he thought he could make me feel
pleased at bein' woke up. But I was n't
goin' to feel pleased. I tell you, Mrs. Lathrop,
a stitch in time saves nine, an' I
hadn't no idea of encouragin' Elijah to
wake me like that, not while there's maybe
a chance of me havin' him to board more 'n
the three months I promised. I saw as I
was gettin' into the duster as all my comfort
depended on how I acted right then an'
there an' I was decided to be firm. I stood
by the bed an' looked at him hard an' then I
says to him, I says, 'Well, what did you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
wake me up for?' 'No one ever felt nothin'
like this,' he says; 'I've got two appendixes
an' I can feel another comin' in my back.'
'Elijah,' I said, 'don't talk nonsense.
You've been an' woke me up an' now I'm
woke up what do you want me to do?' I
leaned over him as I said it an' let a little
hot candle grease drip on his neck an' he
give a yowl an' straightened out an' then
give another yowl an' shut up again. 'I'll
make you some ginger tea,' I says, 'an' put
a mustard plaster wherever you like best,'
I says, 'an' then I shall look to be let alone,'
I says, an' so I went downstairs an' set to
work. Well, Mrs. Lathrop, I made that
tea an' I bet I made it strong; I put some
red pepper in it, too, an' poured a little
mucilage into the plaster, for I may in
confidence remark as I didn't intend as
Elijah should ever look forward to wakin'
me up in the night again. Then I went
upstairs an' he sit up an' took the whole
of the cup at one gulp! You never see no
one so satisfied with nothin' in all your life!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
He fell back like he was shot an' said,
'Scott, Scott, Scott,' until really I thought
as he was ravin'. Then I said, 'Where do
you want the plaster, Elijah?' an' he said,
'On my throat, I guess.' I says, 'No,
Elijah, you've waked me up an' wakin'
me up is nothin' to joke over. You put
this plaster on an' go to sleep an' don't
wake me up again unless you feel for more
tea.' I spoke kind, but he could see as I
felt firm an' I set the candle down an'
went back to bed.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop, what do you think,&mdash;what
<i>do</i> you think? Seems as Elijah
was so afraid o' burnin' himself in another
place that he went an' put the <i>sheet</i> between
him an' the plaster an' glued himself all
together. This mornin' when he awoke up
there he was with the sheet stuck firm to
him an' I must say I was very far from
pleased when he hollered to me an' I went
in an' found him lookin' more like a kite
than anythin' else an' not able to dress
'cause he could n't take off his sheet. 'Well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Elijah, you <i>have</i> done it now, I guess,' I
says; 'I never see nothin' the beat o' this.
If I have to send for young Dr. Brown to
take that sheet off you, you'll be in the
papers from the earthquake to Russia an'
back again.' Well, that was all there was
to do an' when 'Liza Em'ly come with the
milk I had to ask her to go up to young Dr.
Brown's an' ask him to kindly come as
soon as he could an' amputate Elijah out
o' bed. He come right after breakfast an'
he had a time, I tell you! We worked with
water an' we worked with hot water, we
tried loosenin' the edges by jerkin' quick
when Elijah was n't expectin', but it was
all no use. Dr. Brown said he never see
such a plaster, he said it'd be a fortune
for mendin' china. Then we got the dish-pan
an' tried layin' Elijah face down across
it an' pilin' books on his back to keep the
right place in front soakin', but even that
didn't help. Dr. Brown said in the end
as he thought the only way maybe would
be to do all the corners of the sheet up in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
a paper an' let Elijah carry it hugged tight
to him an' wear father's duster down to
the crick an' sit in it till he just slowly
come loose. But Elijah did n't want to go
bathin' in a duster an' I had a feelin' myself
as if Meadville heard of it we'd surely
be very much talked about, so finally Dr.
Brown said he thought as he'd go home
an' study up the case, an' I let him go for
I had my own ideas as to how much he
knew about what was makin' the trouble.
So he went an' then I got dinner an' took
some up to Elijah an' told him jus' what I
thought of the whole performance. I talked
kind but I talked firm an' I done a lot of
good, for he said he did n't know but it
would be better if he arranged to live with
the Whites after the Fourth of July 'cause
he had a feelin' as maybe he was a good
deal of trouble to me. I told him I hadn't
a mite of doubt as he was a good deal of
trouble to me an' then Mrs. Macy come.
I had to stop talkin' to him an' go down
an' tell her what was the matter. She said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
right off as her idea would be to shut the
windows, build a big fire an' make Elijah
jus' work himself loose from the inside
out. I told her about the mucilage though
an' then she changed her views an' said I'd
best fold the sheet neatly an' let him wear
it till he wore it off next time he growed a
new skin. Mrs. Macy says she's been told
we keep sheddin' our skins the same as
snakes an' that that's really what makes
our clothes need washin' so often. She
said the moral was plain as by the time
the sheet'd need washin' Elijah would shed
it anyhow. I see the p'int o' what she said
an' I felt to agree, but while we was talkin'
Mrs. Sweet come in an' her view was all
different. She said as Elijah would find
that sheet a most awful drag on him an'
to her order o' thinkin' he'd ought to go
down to where Mr. Kimball makes his
dried apples an' steam loose in the vat.
She says he can steam out very fast an' Mr.
Kimball bein' his uncle 'll naturally let him
sit in the vat for nothin'."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>"What&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," said Susan; "Lucy
come in while we was sittin' there an' she
said her view'd be for me just to take a
firm hold of the sheet an' walk straight out
of the room without a so much as 'by your
leave' to Elijah, but I'd be afraid of tearin'
the sheet if I did that way. An' then
Gran'ma Mullins came an' her view was
as I'd best sit an' sop Elijah with a sponge,
which just shows why Hiram is so tore in
two between such a mother an' such a
wife's views."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop again.</p>

<p>"Well, Elijah was writin' a editorial when
I left an' 'Liza Em'ly was lookin' at him an'
sighin' to talk an' I come over to tell you
all about it."</p>

<p>Just here a piercing scream was heard
from across the way.</p>

<p>"My&mdash;" ejaculated Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>Susan sprang to her feet and ran to the
door; as she opened it Eliza Emily was
seen flying down the Clegg steps.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it?" screamed Miss Clegg from
Mrs. Lathrop's steps.</p>

<p>"Elijah dropped his pen," screamed Eliza
Emily in reply, "an' when he reached for
it he fell out o' bed an' tore loose."</p>

<p>"Did he tear the sheet any?"</p>

<p>"No, but he thinks he's tore himself."</p>

<p>Miss Clegg began to walk rapidly towards
her own house.</p>

<p>"You can see I've got to go," she called
back to her friend over her shoulder; "this
is what it is to have a man livin' in your
house, Mrs. Lathrop."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="center">THE BEGINNING OF THE END</p>


<p>As June wore on it became more and
more apparent that Elijah wore on
Miss Clegg. She grew less and less mild
towards his shortcomings and more and
more severe as to the same.</p>

<p>"He's only&mdash;" Mrs. Lathrop attempted
to explain to her.</p>

<p>"I don't care if he is," she replied, "it
says in the Bible as a man is a man for all
that an' I never was one to go against the
Bible even if I ain't never felt in conscience
called to say where Cain an' Abel got
married, or what it was as the Jews lit out
from Egypt on a'count of. I tell you what
it is, Mrs. Lathrop, you've forgotten what
it is to have a man around your house.
There's somethin' just about the way a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
man eats an' sleeps as gets very aggravatin'
to any woman after the new's off. I
begin to see what men invented gettin'
married for,&mdash;it was so they could kite
around an' always be sure they had one
woman safe chained up at home to do their
cookin' an' washin'. Why, I ain't married
to Elijah a <i>tall</i>, an' yet just havin' him in
the house is gettin' me more an' more
under his thumb every day that he stays
with me. I feel to stay in the square an'
I find myself hurryin' home 'cause he likes
hot biscuits, an' I feel to turn his washstand
around an' I leave it where it is for
no better reason than as he likes it where
it is. It's awful the way a man gets the
upper hand of a woman! Lord knows I've
no love for Elijah an' yet I'm caperin'
upstairs an' downstairs when he ain't in
a hurry an' tearin' my legs off scamperin'
when he is, until I declare I feel mad at
myself&mdash;I certainly do.</p>

<p>"An' now, there he is fallin' in love with
'Liza Em'ly, the last girl in the world as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
he'd ought to even dream of marryin', an'
I talk to him an' talk to him, an' tell him
so, an' tell him so, an' it don't make no
more impression than when you rub a
cat behind her ear."</p>

<p>"Why, a cat&mdash;" protested Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Yes, an' so does Elijah. It just tickles
him half to death to hear 'Liza Em'ly's
mere name, an' he don't care what any one
says about her just so long as it's about
her.</p>

<p>"I see the minister down in the square
to-day an' I told him my opinion of it all
right to his face. But the minister didn't
have no heart for 'Liza Em'ly&mdash;he's too
used up discussin' what under the sun is to
be done with Henry Ward Beecher. He
says it's suthin' just awful about Henry
Ward Beecher's feelin' for Emma Sweet,
an' he told me frank an' open as personally
it's been so terrible easy for him to get
himself married an' get consequences that
he can't find nothin' to point his index
finger into Henry Ward Beecher with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
about this unrequited affection of his for
Emma. He says as he never knowed as a
<i>man</i> could have unrequited affection afore
an' he really seems to feel more'n a little
hurt over it. He says he can't well see
how to restrain Henry Ward Beecher an'
it's town talk as Henry Ward Beecher is
far past restrainin' himself. I see Polly
White afterward an' she says it's gospel
truth as he's took indelible ink an' tattoed
Emma all over himself, even places where
he had to do it by guess or a mirror."</p>

<p>"My heavens!" ejaculated Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Well, I should say so," said Susan,
"an' will you only consider, Mrs. Lathrop,
what Emma Sweet is to be tattoed all over
any man like that! I like all the Sweets
an' I like Emma, but it's only in reason as
I should regard her with a impartial eye,
an' no impartial eye lookin' her way could
ever in reason deny as she don't appear
likely to set no rivers afire. Emma's a
nice girl, an' if her toes turned out an' her
teeth turned in I don't say but what she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
might go along without bein' noticed in a
crowd, but with them teeth an' toes all you
can call her is good-hearted an' you know
as well as I do as bein' called good-hearted
is about the meanest thing as anybody
can ever call anybody else. Folks in this
world never call any one good-hearted unless
they can't find nothin' else good to say
of 'em, for it stands to reason as any sensible
person'd rather have anythin' else about
'em good before their heart, for it's way
inside an' largely guesswork what it is
anyhow.</p>

<p>"They say as Mrs. Sweet says as even
though Emma's her own child, still she can't
see no reason for Henry Ward Beecher's
March-haredness. She says Emma's best
p'ints is her gettin' up early an' the way
she puts her whole soul into washin' an'
bread-kneadin', but she says Henry Ward
Beecher ain't sensible enough to appreciate
good p'ints like those. She says she's
talked to Emma an' any one with half a
eye can see as it ain't Emma as needs the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
talkin' to. She says Emma says as the
way he hangs onto her goin' home from
choir practice is enough to pull her patience
all out of proportion. She says Emma
says she'd as soon have a garter-snake
seein' her home, an' doin' itself up in rings
around her all the while, an' Mrs. Sweet
says any one as has ever seen Emma seein'
a garter-snake would consider Henry Ward
Beecher's chances as very slim after a
remark like that.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kimball says he wishes he had n't
took him into his store just now; he says
no young man ain't got a call to the grocery
trade when he's in a state of heart as won't
let him hear the call o' the man as owns
the business, an' Mr. Kimball says when
he fell into the vat where he was stirrin'
up his dried apples, Henry Ward Beecher
never heard one single holler as he gave&mdash;not
one single solitary holler did that boy
hear, an' Mr. Kimball 'most had a real
city Turkish bath as a result. Why, he
told me as he was in the vat for nigh on to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
a hour afore Elijah heard him from the
other side, an' he says as a consequence he
ain't very much took with havin' a clerk
as is in love. He says too as only to see
Henry Ward Beecher tryin' to pour through
a funnel when any member o' the Sweet
family is walkin' by on the other side of
the square is enough to make him as owns
what's bein' spilt wish as Henry Ward
Beecher's father had gone unrequited too.
Mrs. Macy come in while we was talkin'
an' she said it was too bad as Emma wasn't
smarter, 'cause if Emma was smarter Henry
Ward Beecher'd jus' suit her. Mrs. Macy
says the trouble is as Emma's too smart
to be willin' to marry a fool an' not quite
smart enough to be willin' to. Mrs. Macy
says as Mr. Fisher was just such another
an' Mrs. Fisher jumped for him like a duck
at a bug."</p>

<p>"Did&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop, interestedly.</p>

<p>"No," said Susan, "but Gran'ma Mullins
did. Gran'ma Mullins is always nothin'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
but glad to have a chance to shake her
head an' wipe her eyes over any one's love-makin'.
She come in to wait a little 'cause
Lucy wanted to dust an' she says she ain't
got no strength to stay in the house while
Lucy dusts; she says it lays Hiram out on
the sofa every time regular an' sometimes
it gives him the toothache. She says she
an' Hiram never know when they 're dirty
a'cordin' to Lucy's way o' thinkin' but,
Heaven help 'em, they always know when
they're clean a'cordin' to Lucy's idea of
bein' clean. She says Lucy is that kind
as takes one of her hairpins an' goes down
on her knees an' scratches out the last bit
of dirt as the Lord hath mercifully seen
fit to allow to settle in His cracks. You
can see as Gran'ma Mullins has suffered!
She says it's a hard thing to bear, but
Hiram grins an' she bears an' their pride
helps 'em out.</p>

<p>"While we was talkin' Emma come by for
the mail an' we see Henry Ward Beecher's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>face just hoverin' madly over the breakfast-food
display in Mr. Kimball's window. Mr.
Jilkins was in town buyin' a rake an' he
waited to see what would happen. Judge
Fitch was there too an' Polly White. We
all had our eyes fixed on Henry Ward
Beecher an' I will say, Mrs. Lathrop, as I
never got so tired waitin' for nothin'."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Love affairs is terrible tame to lookers-on,
I think. If they get over it your time's
wasted an' if they don't get over it the
time's wasted all around. My own opinion is
as all love affairs is a very foolish kind o'
business, for you never find real sensible
folks havin' anythin' to do with 'em. But
it was no use talkin' that to-day, so Henry
Ward Beecher hung up there on the breakfast
foods, an' we sat an' watched him
like combination cats till long about five
Johnny come by an' said as Mr. Sperrit
had took Emma home with them to tea."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;" cried Mrs. Lathrop, impulsively.</p>

<p>"I don't know why not," said Susan,
"my own opinion is as he's a idiot&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Sper&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Henry Ward Beecher. It's always
struck me as a very strange thing as we
had n't got one single idiot in this community
an' I guess the real truth is as
we've had one all the time an' did n't
know him by sight. There's a idiot most
everywhere till he gets the idea into his
head to kill some one an' so gives others the
idea as he's safer shut up, an' so it ain't
surprisin' our havin' one too. I see Mrs.
Brown on my way home an' I asked her
if she did n't think as I was right. She
said she would n't be surprised if it was
true, an' it was very odd as she'd never
thought o' it before, recollectin' her experience
with him years ago when she had
him that time as the minister went to
the Sperrits' on his vacation. She went
on to say then as to her order o' thinkin'
Mr. an' Mrs. Sperrit come pretty close to
bein' idiots themselves, for she says she
don't know she's sure what ails 'em but
they've been married years now an' is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
still goin' round as beamin' as two full
moons. She says it ain't anythin' to talk
of in public but actually to see 'em drivin'
back from market sometimes most makes
her wish as she was n't a widow, an' she
says anythin' as'd make her sorry she's a
widow had n't ought to be goin' round loose
in a Christian town. She was very much
in earnest an' Mrs. Fisher overtook us just
then an' she said it all over again to her an'
she said more, too&mdash;she said as the way
she looks at him in church is all right an'
really nothin' but a joy to look on afore
marriage, but she don't consider it hardly
decent afterwards for it's deludin' an' can't
possibly be meant in earnest. She says
she was married, an' her son is married,
an' her father was married, too, an' you
can't tell her that the way Mr. an' Mrs.
Sperrit go on isn't suthin' pretty close to
idiocy even if it ain't the whole thing."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Fisher said," continued Susan,
"as she thought maybe she got used to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
lookin' pleasant at him in all them years
as she kept house for him afore he made
up his mind to get married to her, an' so
the habit kind of is on her an' what's dyed
in the wool keeps on stickin' to Mr. Sperrit.
She said as they do say as he married her
'cause he wanted her bedroom to hang up
corn to dry in. She went on to say as for
her part she always enjoyed seein' the
Sperrits so happy for it done any one good
to only look at 'em an' that she'd only be
too happy to be a idiot herself if it'd do
any human bein' good to look at her an'
Mr. Fisher afterwards. She went on to
say as she'd heard as the other night Mr.
Sperrit drove two miles back in the rain
'cause he'd forgot a cake o' sapolio as she'd
asked him to bring. I spoke up at that an'
I said I did n't see nothin' very surprisin'
in that, for I know if I asked any man as
I was married to to bring home a cake o'
sapolio I should most surely look to see
the cake when he come home."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know; but you always spoiled him,"
said Susan. "Well, what was I sayin'?
Oh, yes, Mrs. Brown said as Mrs. Macy
was tellin' her the other day as they've
got a idiot in Meadville&mdash;a real hereditary
one; the doctors have all studied him
an' it's a clear case right down from his
great-grandfather."</p>

<p>"His great&mdash;" cried Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Grandfather," said Susan. "Yes, Mrs.
Lathrop, that is how it was, an' Mrs. Macy
says it's really so, for she see the tombstones
all but the mother's&mdash;hers ain't
done yet. Seems the idiocy come from
the great-grandfather's stoppin' on the
train crossin' to pick up a frog 'cause he
was runnin' for suthin' in connection with
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals."</p>

<p>"The frog!" cried Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"No, the great-grandfather. Seems he
never stopped to consider as what'd kill a
frog would be sure to hit him, an' Mrs.
Macy says the doctors said as that was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
one very strong piece o' evidence against
the family brains right at the start, but
she says he really was smarter than they
thought, for the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals paid for the funeral
an' for the grandmother's, too."</p>

<p>"The grand&mdash;" cried Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"&mdash;Mother's," said Susan. "Yes, seems
the railway track was their back fence an'
she'd always begged an' prayed him at
the top o' her voice not to go to town that
way, but he would n't listen 'cause he was
stone-deaf an' then besides like all that
kind he always pretended not to hear what
he did n't want to. But anyhow she was
in the garden an' she see the train an' she
tried to get to him, an' whether she broke
a blood vessel yellin' or contracted heart
disease hoppin' up an' down, anyway she
fell over right then an' there an' it would
have been copied in all the newspapers all
over the country even if the mother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The moth&mdash;" cried Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Er," said Susan. "Yes, seems she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
heard the yell an' run to the window so
quick she knocked the stick out as held
it up an' it come down on her head. So,
you see the idiocy come right straight down
in the family of the idiot for three generations
afore him."</p>

<p>"I ain't sure," said Mrs. Lathrop,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I ain't either," said Susan; "Mrs. Macy
says, she was n't either. No one in Meadville
never was."</p>

<p>"An' yet&mdash;" began Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that," said Susan, "that's
altogether another kind o' idiot. Henry
Ward Beecher won't die of his love even if
Emma won't have him, an' they'll both
always be the better an' happier for not
havin' one another, if they only knew it.
It's mighty easy to love folks an' think
how happy you'd always be with 'em as
long as you don't marry 'em. It's marryin'
'em an' livin' in the house with 'em as
shows you how hard it is to be really married.
I thank Heaven I'm only livin'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
in the house with Elijah an' not married
to him, so I can see my way ahead to gettin'
rid of him in a little while now. You don't
know how I ache to draw the curtains of
his room an' pin up the bed an' pour the
water out of his pitcher an' set a mouse
trap in there an' just know it is n't goin'
to be mussed up again."</p>

<p>Susan sighed deeply.</p>

<p>"How long&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"I said three months," said Miss Clegg,
"an' that takes it over the Fourth of July.
My heavens alive, seems some days as if
I could n't but just live, an' the meanest
thing about a man is, he's so dead sure
as he makes you happy, bein' around the
house."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="center">AN OLD-FASHIONED FOURTH</p>


<p>"Well, Elijah seems to have hit the
nail on its foot instead of its head
this time," said Miss Clegg to Mrs. Lathrop
on the noon of the Sunday before the
Fourth of July; "that editorial of his in
this week's paper ain't suitin' any one a <i>tall</i>.
I was down in the square yesterday an'
everybody as was there was talkin' about
it, an' to-day after church everybody was
still talkin' about it, an' gettin' more mad
all the time."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;" began Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"The one about the celebration as he
printed in this week's paper," replied her
friend; "they was for discussin' nothin'
else after church to-day, an' one an' all is
dead set against the way as Elijah says.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Them as has bought their fireworks ain't
pleased, of course, an' Mr. Kimball says
as he considers that Elijah had ought to
of consulted him afore he printed such a
article in the hind part of a uncle's store
that had just laid in a new supply of two
pounds of punk alone. Mr. Kimball says
as he'd planned a window display o' cannon
crackers pointin' all ways out of a fort
built o' his new dried apples an' now here's
Elijah comin' out in Saturday's paper for
an old-fashioned Fourth o' July without
no firecrackers a <i>tall</i>. Mr. Kimball says
he thinks Elijah ought to remember whose
nephew he is an' show some family feelin';
he says punk is a thing as can never be
worked off in no bargain lot of odds an'
ends, an' he says his own Fourth o' July is
spoiled now anyway just by the shock of
the worry 'cause he can't be sure how
folks is goin' to be affected until the effect
is over, an' the Fourth o' July'll be over
mighty quick this year. 'T ain't like they
had most a week to calm down from Elijah's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
new idea&mdash;they ain't got but just Monday
to decide an' buy their fireworks, too.</p>

<p>"Judge Fitch says he can't quite make
out what Elijah meant by callin' for patriotic
speeches; he says he's willin' to
make a speech any day, but he says no
one ever wants to stop poppin' long enough
to listen to a speech on the Fourth o' July.
He says too as it's very hard to get a still
crowd that day 'cause people are afraid to
get absorbed listenin' for fear suthin' may
go off under 'em while they ain't keepin'
watch. Mr. Dill said that was true, 'cause
he had a personal experience that way in
his own dog; he says that dog would of
made a fine hunter only some one throwed a
torpedo at him one Fourth o' July, when
he was lookin' under a sidewalk, an' after
that that dog almost had a fit if a sparrow
chirped quick behind him. Mr. Dill said
he tried to cure him by stuffin' cotton in
his ears an' keepin' a cloth tied neatly
around his head, but then he read in the
paper about some deaf German as when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
he played the piano always listened with
his teeth, an' he said that just made him
empty the cotton right out of the dog an'
give up.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Macy says what she wants to know
is what's Elijah tryin' to get at anyhow.
She says she always thought a barbecue
was a kind of cake an' she did n't know
white folks ever could lift their legs that
high, even if they felt to want to. She says
the idea of its bein' suthin' to eat in the
woods is surely most new to her an' she
ain't sure she wants to eat in the woods
anyhow. She says there's always flies an'
mosquitoes in the woods an' she's passed
the age o' likin' to drop down anywhere,
an' jump up any time, years ago. As for
cookin' in the woods she says that part of
Elijah's editorial is too much for every one.
She says she never hear of roastin' a ox
whole in a pit in her life; she says how is
the ox to be got into the pit an' what's to
cook him while he's in there an' when he's
cooked how's he to be got out again to eat?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
She says she thinks Elijah has got a ox an'
a clam mixed in his mind, an' a pit an' a pile.
She says she knows they cook clams in piles
on the seashore, 'cause she's heard so from
people as has been there, an' besides she
seen a picture of one once.</p>

<p>"Gran'ma Mullins came up an' she's most
awful troubled over the ox, too. She says
Hiram is got such a name for bein' strong
now that she just knows as they'll expect
him to put that ox into the pit when they're
ready to cook him, an' then lift him out
again when he's done. She says it's gettin'
too terrible about Hiram, every time as
somebody fat dies anywhere or there's a
piano to move or a barn to get up on jack-screws
they send right for Hiram to be one
o' the pallbearers an' give him the heaviest
corner. Why, she says the other day when
that refrigerator came for Polly White
they unloaded it right onto Hiram from
the train, an' not a soul dreamed as there
was shot packed in both sides of it to save
rates, until poor Hiram set it down to put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
it on the other shoulder. She says too,
as she can't well see how a ox can be roasted
whole anyway; she says it'll be a awful
job gettin' his hair singed off in the first
place, an' she just knows they'll expect
Hiram to hold him an' twirl him while
he's singein'. Then, too, she says as the
whole of a ox don't want to be roasted
anyhow. The tongue has to be boiled an'
the liver has to be sliced an' the calves'
brains has to be breaded an' dipped in egg,
an' after he's roasted an' Hiram has got him
out o' the pit, who's to skin him then, she'd
like to know, for you can't tell her as anybody
can eat rawhide, even if it is cooked.</p>

<p>"Deacon White come up, an' he said he
an' Polly would bring their own lunch an'
their own pillow an' blanket an' hammock
an' look on, 'cause Polly wanted to see the
fun an' they were n't intendin' to have
any fireworks anyhow. He said he was
curious about the ox himself; he said he
wondered where they'd get the ox, an' the
pit, too, for that matter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"He said he wanted it distinctly understood
as he an' Polly'd bring their own
lunch an' neither borrow nor lend. He
said that rule would apply to the pillow
an' the blanket an' the hammock, the same
as to the lunch. There was some talk
after he was gone on how terrible close he
an' Polly are both gettin'. Seems kind of
funny, to be so savin' when you ain't got
nobody to save for, but the Whites an'
Allens was always funny an' what's bred
in the flesh always sticks the bones out
somewhere, as we all know.</p>

<p>"The minister come up an' he said as
it says in the Bible as when the ox is in
the pit every one must join in an' help him
out, so he shall do his part an' bring all
his family with him. But he said he must
remark as to his order of thinkin' a ox
struck him as a most singular way to commemorate
the day our forefathers fought
an' bled over. He says he should have
thought a service o' song an' a much to be
desired donation towards <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's note: typo for cleanin'">cleainin'</ins> out his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
cistern would have been a more fittin' way
to spend the glorious Fourth in, than fixin'
a ox in a pit an' tryin' to bake him there.
He says he don't think it can be done anyhow,
he says a ox ain't no chestnut to stick
in the ashes till he bounces out cooked o'
his own accord.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Fisher says she sha'n't have nothin'
to do with any of it; they're all goin' to
the city, an' Mr. Fisher is goin' to a lecture
on that Russian that his country wants to
amalgamate for suthin' he's done; an' she
an' John Bunyan is goin' to the Hippodrome.
They want to see the girl turn
upside down in the automobile an' Mrs.
Fisher says she can hear about the ox
when she comes back.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Brown says they sha'n't go, 'cause
young Dr. Brown's afraid o' microbes in
the woods. He's goin' to disinfect everythin'
with that new smell he's invented
the day before the Fourth, an' then they're
goin' to have huckleberry biscuit an' watermelon
an' just spend a quiet day waitin'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
for any accidents as may maybe come
along. Mrs. Brown says young Dr. Brown is
always hopin' for another railroad smash-up
like that one that came while he was away
studyin'. She says it always seems too
bad it couldn't have come a year later,
when he was just back with that handsome
brand new set of doctor's knives an' forks
as he got for a prize." Susan paused.</p>

<p>"Shall you&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"No, I sha'n't. I ain't interested in the
Fourth o' July. I never had nothin' to do
with it in the beginnin' an' I ain't never
had nothin' to do with it since. My own
idea's always been as the Boston people
was very foolish to go throwin' their tea
overboard sooner'n buy stamps. We all buy
stamps now an' no one thinks o' fussin'
over it, an' I guess we do a lot other things
as we'd never of had to do if we'd kept
our tea an' our mouths shut in the beginnin'.
They say tea is very cheap in England an'
very good, too, an' heaven knows nothin'
is cheap with us. Elijah says if it wasn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
for his uncle he'd take a strong stand on
a low tariff, but my goodness, it looks to
me like he'd better not meddle with the
tariff&mdash;he's set the town by the ears
enough with his ox. I had a long talk
with him last night about the whole thing.
I don't know, I'm sure, how Elijah ever is
goin' to get on without me, for I certainly
do talk to him enough to keep him in ideas
right straight along. I was very kind last
night&mdash;but I was firm, too. In the end
I broke him down completely an' he told
me as he never meant it that way a <i>tall</i>.
He says he only drew a picture o' what the
Fourth o' July was in olden times. But
this town ain't good on pictures, we take
things right up by the handle an' deal with
'em a'cordin'."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course not," said Susan, "but
they can take him up by the tail an' horns,
can't they?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">CELEBRATING INDEPENDENCE DAY</p>


<p>"Well," said Miss Clegg to her friend
the Sunday after the Fourth, "I'm
thankful to say as the game is up to-morrow
an' Elijah moves out of my house. We
never had no Fourth o' July like this afore
an' every one is prayin' as we'll never have
such another again. It was really very
peaceful in church this mornin' an' the collection
was thirty-two cents, so that shows
as folks is beginnin' to take heart again, but
you could see as they was all nervous an'
even the minister kept lookin' anxiously out
of the window whenever he thought as he
heard a noise. Mr. Weskin says he thinks
a house catchin' fire from bein' disinfected
comes under some head as lets the insurance
get paid anyhow an' he says if not he'll take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
the case for the Browns on even halves for
his heart is full o' sympathy for 'em. The
Browns was in church themselves to-day,
all but Amelia, an' I had the story from
them straight for the first time. Young
Dr. Brown says he can't understand any of
it; he says the stuff must be stirred in a
barrel for two hours without stoppin' an'
he says he'll let any man breathe a suspicion
as his mother stopped after he once
set her at it! Mrs. Brown says she did n't
stop neither, she says when she could n't
move her arms any more for love or money,
she stuck the broomstick through her belt
an' sat on the edge o' the barrel an' kept
the stuff stirrin' so. They poured in the
acid right after breakfast, an' then Dr.
Brown wanted the test to be thorough, so
they put a live fly in each room, shut the
doors between, shut all the windows, took
the silver out on the lawn, an' then threw
a match into the barrel an' run out the
coal cellar door.</p>

<p>"Amelia is up at her father's an' ain't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
able to speak of it yet, but Mrs. Brown
says her own view of it will always be as it
was a explosion. She says as she can't see
how you could call it anythin' else in the
world. She says they was all sittin' in the
arbor an' Amelia was just gettin' into the
hammock an' Dr. Brown was just beginnin'
on the King o' Spain's honeymoon in the
paper, with a picture of a bullfight to
illustrate it, when she heard such a noise
as she never will forget again in all her
life to come. She says her first thought
was as Amelia had bu'st the hammock,
for she says she tries to be kind to the
bosom wife of her chosen son, but Amelia
is surely most awful hard on anythin' as
you get in an' out of, but then she heard
the second noise, an' she says to her dyin'
day she won't be able to swear to nothin'
but as she thought it was San Francisco
quakin' right in our very middle. Why,
she says, she never for one second doubted
as it was a earthquake. The canary-bird
cage come sailin' out o' the dinin'-room<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
window, all the chimneys went down with
a crash, an' Amelia give one yell an' fainted.
Mrs. Brown says she an' young Dr. Brown
did n't really know which way to turn for
a minute. They could n't seem to think
whether their first duty was to shake
Amelia or run around to the front of the
house. The windows was blowin' out as
fast as they could an' the most awful
smellin' smoke you ever smelt was pourin'
out after them! She said the smell was
bad enough when she was stirrin' the stuff
in the barrel, but exploded, it was just
beyond all belief. In the end they left
Amelia an' run 'round behind the house an'
if there was n't all the kitchen stove lids
comin' bangin' out at 'em an' all the feathers
from the pillows just rainin' down like
snow! They run aroun' to the side an'
there was Amelia's sheets o' music all over
the lawn an' jars o' pickles with the glass
lids gone, an' jelly tumblers an' weddin'
gold-rimmed china, an' in front an' on top
of all else if the fire did n't bu'st out!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dr. Brown run for the fire engine then
an' every one was at home gettin' ready
for the picnic an' there wa'n't no one down
town a <i>tall</i>. He was all of ten minutes
findin' any one an' when he found him it
was only Mr. Shores, an' Mrs. Brown says
as gettin' out a fire engine with Mr. Shores
an' your house burnin' is suthin' as she
trusts will never be her lot again. She says
Mr. Shores would n't lay hold o' the engine
till after the cover was folded up neatly
an' then he wanted to dust the wheels afore
runnin' it out. Then after it was run out
an' got to the house, if there wa'n't no hose,
an' Dr. Brown had to run away back to the
engine house for the hose an' while he was
runnin' he met John Bunyan runnin' too
an' John Bunyan told him as the hose was
kept coiled up in the part as sticks up
behind the engine like a can. So they run
back together an' got it out an' run with
it to the well an' Dr. Brown was so excited
he dropped the hose in the well. Mrs.
Brown says she was nigh too mad by this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
time with the house explodin' all over
again every few minutes an' things as you
never have around comin' sailin' out o'
the windows right in people's faces when
they was only there to be neighborly an'
look on. She was runnin' back an' forth
an' explainin' as it was n't for want o'
stirrin', for she stirred it herself, when
Sam Duruy come runnin' an' seems there's
always another hose tied up under the
engine an' he unhooked that an' John
Bunyan built a fire in the hole for fire while
they fixed the new hose in the cistern, but
oh my, the house was too far gone to be
saved by that time. So they pumped
some on Amelia just to try the hose, an'
then they helped pick up the things as
was blowed out of the windows. Mrs.
Brown says it was all most awful an' she
knows from her son's face as he thinks it
was all because she stopped stirrin' sometimes
durin' the two hours an' she declares
with tears as she never stopped stirrin'
once&mdash;not <i>once</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mrs. Fisher says the way people is sick
from the smell shows as all the flies they
put in the rooms must of surely been killed,
so the experiment's a success in one way
at least. Mrs. Fisher walked part way
home with me an' we had a nice talk about
the Browns. She says the Browns is most
amusin' always in the ways they use flies;
she says when young Dr. Brown was little,
Mrs. Brown used to put a fly in the sugar-box
when she went down to the square
for things so she could tell when she come
back whether he'd been at the sugar, an'
so let the fly out. She says young Dr.
Brown cured her o' that happy thought
by takin' the fly out himself when she was
down town one time an' puttin' a mad
bee in instead. She says she guesses Dr.
Brown has given her many a little lesson
like that or he'd never be able to keep
her stirrin' anythin' as smells for two
hours."</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Well, the Fitches took Amelia an' her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
husband of course an' Mrs. Brown is goin'
over to Meadville to-morrow. Mrs. Macy
says maybe old Dr. Carter will marry her
now as she ain't got any house to be attached
to. I don't see why that would n't be a
good end for Mrs. Brown, she can step right
into Mrs. Carter's shoes&mdash;an' her clothes,
too, for that matter, for he never give away
a thing when she died. Yes, he did, too,
though, she wanted her nieces to have a
souvenir an' he give one the waist an' the
other the skirt to the same dress, but Mrs.
Fisher says what he would n't give away
to no man for love or money was all her
union underwear for winter. Seems she
always wore the best an' finest, an' when
she died Dr. Carter said he'd keep all them
union suits an' wear 'em out himself."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"No, an' I would n't either," said Miss
Clegg; "there would n't be no comfort
marryin' a man whose first wife could n't
call even her union suits her own after she
died, not to my order of thinkin'."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>"Was&mdash;" asked her friend.</p>

<p>"Oh, the picnic?" said Susan, "no, that
was n't a success a <i>tall</i>. They spread the
tablecloth over a flyin' ant nest in the
first place an' Mrs. Macy says shad bones
is nothin' to the pickin' out as they had
to do while eatin' as a consequence. She
says they very soon found out as they was
under a wood-tick tree too, an' the children
run into a burr-patch after dinner. The
minister tried to teach the twins to fish
an' the bank caved in with 'em all three,
an' the minister had to go all the way home
that way. Gran'ma Mullins got a gnat
in her eye an' Hiram walked way back to
town for a flaxseed to put in it to get the
gnat out, an' crossin' the bridge he sneezed
an' the flaxseed just disappeared completely,
an' Lucy would n't let him go
back again, so all she could do was to keep
a-rubbin' till finally she rubbed it out. Mr.
Dill climbed up a tree to show as he could
still climb up a tree an' a branch broke an'
tore him so bad he had to walk home with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
the minister,&mdash;I guess every one's glad
the Fourth's over."</p>

<p>"How's&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Elijah? Oh, he went to town for the
day. He says it's him for town when
there 's anythin' goin' on in the country.
He come back lookin' like he'd really enjoyed
himself, but I was afraid he was
goin' to have a fever at first he talked so
queer in his sleep that night an' began all
his sentences with 'Here's to&mdash;' an' then
stopped in a most curious way. I was very
much relieved when I see him come downstairs
the next mornin', only his appetite
ain't what it was yet."</p>

<p>"May&mdash;" suggested Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think so. There ain't any
one for him to be in love with anyhow
unless it's 'Liza Em'ly. He's really too
smart for any girl in this community an'
he ain't got a single picture among his
things nor a letter as I don't know who
wrote it. I thought at first as he used to
call 'Annie' in his sleep the nights after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
we have dumplin's, but it ain't 'Annie'
he says; it's 'Aunty,' an' heaven knows
a aunt never broke no man's heart yet."</p>

<p>Susan rose to go home.</p>

<p>"I'm glad the Fourth's over, anyway,"
she said as she took up her parasol and
mitts. "I think it's always a great strain
on the country, but even if no one never
likes it nor enjoys it, I suppose we must
keep on havin' it with us year after year,
for Elijah says as, as a nation, we're so
proud o' bein' ahead o' everythin' an'
everybody, that we'll die afore we'll go on
one step further. He says what's one day
o' terror a year beside the idea as we're
free to do as we please. Gran'ma Mullins
says all she can say is as she thanks God
for every Fourth o' July as leaves Hiram
whole, for he's the only apple she's got for
her eye an' she'd go stark ravin' mad if
anythin' was to tear him apart in the dream
of his youth."</p>

<p>"Did&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop, solicitously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I can't stop to see if I did or
did n't now," said Miss Clegg; "to-night's
my last evenin' with Elijah an' I told him
to be sure an' be home early. We'll try
an' part pleasantly even though I should
be mighty mad at him if I thought as he
was half as glad to go as I am to get rid of
him. I don't like the ways of a man in the
house, Mrs. Lathrop,&mdash;they seem to act
like they thought you enjoyed havin' 'em
around. I can't see where they ever got
the idea in the first place, but it certainly
does seem to stick by 'em most wonderful."</p>

<p>"There&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>Susan turned her head.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's him comin'," she said;
"well, now I must go, Mrs. Lathrop. I'll
come over to-morrow an' tell you when I'm
free of him, bag an' baggage."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Lathrop, "I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do, too," said Miss Clegg, "but
you see I said for three months an' the
three months ain't up till to-morrow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">EXIT THE MAN OUT OF SUSAN CLEGG'S HOUSE</p>


<p>"Well, Mrs. Lathrop," said Miss
Clegg, coming over the evening
after, weary but triumphant, "Elijah is
gone an' I tell you I'll never be too tender-hearted
for my own good again. I won't
say but what it was me an' nobody else as
brought him down on my own head, but
I must fully an' freely state as it's certainly
been me an' no one else as has had to hold
my own head up under him. An' he <i>has</i>
been a load!</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Lathrop, do you know that
man's stockin's alone has took me about one
mornin' a week, an' as to buttons&mdash;well, I
never knew a editor could bu'st 'em off so
fast. An' as to puttin' away what he took
off, or foldin' back things into the drawer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
where they belongs, why, a monkey swingin'
upside down by his tail is busy carefully
keepin' house compared to Elijah Doxey.</p>

<p>"I never see such a man afore! If
Hiram's anythin' like him I don't blame
Lucy for battin' him about as she does.
I did n't suppose such ways could be lived
with in oneself. An' that table where he
wrote! Well! I tell you I've got it cleared
off to-night an' my clean curtains folded off
on it, an' no man never sets foot on it again,
I can tell you <i>that</i>.</p>

<p>"I won't say as it wa'n't a little tryin'
gettin' him off to-day an' I did feel to feel
real sober while I was hangin' his mattress
back to the rafters in the attic, but when I
remembered as I'd never see them bedclothes
kicked out at the foot again I
cheered up amazin'. Mrs. Brown come
in just afore supper an' she seemed to
think it was some queer as I was n't goin'
to miss Elijah, but I told her she did n't
know me. 'Mrs. Brown,' I says, 'your son
was a doctor an' you can't be expected to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
know what it is to board a editor, so once
bit, soonest mended. She's mournin' over
her burnt house yet, so she could n't really
feel to sympathize with me, but I had n't
time to stop an' mourn with her,&mdash;I was
too busy packin' away Elijah's toilet set.</p>

<p>"He got a good deal of ink around the
room, Mrs. Lathrop, an' I shall make Mr.
Kimball give me a bottle of ink-remover
free, seein' as he's his nephew; but I
don't see as he done any other real damage.
I looked the room over pretty sharp an'
I can't find nothin' wrong with it. I shall
burn a sulphur candle in there to-morrow
an' then wash out the bureau drawers an'
I guess then as the taste of Elijah'll be
pretty well out of my mouth.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know what we're
comin' to as to men, Mrs. Lathrop, for I
must say they seem more extra in the world
every day. Most everythin' as they do
the women is able to do better now, an'
women is so willin' to be pleasant about it,
too. Not as Elijah was n't pleasant&mdash;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
never see a more pleasant young man, but
he had a way of comin' in with muddy
boots an' a smile on his face as makes me
nothin' but glad as he's left my house an'
gone to Polly White's."</p>

<p>"Won't you&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"No, I won't,&mdash;not if I know myself.
I ain't never been lonesome afore in my
life an' I ain't goin' to begin now. Bein'
lonesome is very fine for them as keeps a
girl to do their work, but I have to slave
all day long if there's anybody but me
around the house, an' I don't like to slave.
I guess Elijah's expectin' to be lonesome
though, for he asked me if I'd mind his
comin' up an' talkin' over the Personal
column with me sometimes. I could see
as he was more'n a little worried over how
under the sun he was goin' to run the
paper without me. As a matter of fact,
Mrs. Lathrop, I've been the main stay of
that paper right from the first. Not to
speak o' boardin' the editor, I've supplied
most o' the brains as run it. You know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
as I never am much of a talker, but I did
try to keep Elijah posted as to how things
was goin' on an' the feelin' as no matter
what I said, it was him an' not me as
would be blamed if there was trouble,
always kept up my courage. There's a
many nights as I've kept him at his work
an' a many others as I've held him down
to it. Elijah has n't been a easy young
man to manage, I can tell you."</p>

<p>Susan stopped and sighed.</p>

<p>"I like to think how he's goin' to miss me
now," she said, "I made him awful comfortable.
Polly'll never do all the little things
as I did. It's a great satisfaction when a
man leaves your house, Mrs. Lathrop, to
know as he'll be bound to wish himself
back there many an' many time."</p>

<p>"What&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll find plenty to do," said Susan
Clegg, "it ain't made a mite of difference
in my life. I shall go on livin' just the
same as ever. Nothin's changed for me
just because for three months I had a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
in the house. I ain't even altered my
general views o' men any, for land knows
Elijah wa'n't so different from the rest of
them that he could teach me much as is new.
I ain't never intended to get married anyway,
so he ain't destroyed my ideals none,
an' I told Mr. Kimball when I took him
as I'd agree to keep him three months an'
I would n't agree for love or money to keep
him any longer, an' I've kept him for three
months an' no love or money could of made
me keep him a day longer."</p>

<p>"Did n't you&mdash;" asked Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I liked him," said Susan,
"there were spots durin' the time when I
felt to be real fond of him, but laws, that
did n't make me want to have him around
any more than I had to. But you know
as well as I do that a woman can like a
man very much an' still be happiest when
she ain't got him on her hands to fuss with.
I was n't built to fuss, Mrs. Lathrop, as
you know to your cost, for if I had been
I'd of been over here two days a week<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
tidyin' up out of pure friendship, for the
last twenty years. But no, I ain't like
that&mdash;never was an' never will be&mdash;an'
I ain't one to go pitchin' my life hither an'
yon an' dancin' wildly first on one leg an'
then the other from dawn to dusk for other
people. Elijah's come an' Elijah's gone an'
his mattress is hung back to the rafter in
the attic an' his sulphur candle is all bought
to burn to-morrow an' when that's over
an' the smell's over too I shall look to
settle down an' not have nothin' more to
upset my days an' nights till your time
comes, Mrs. Lathrop, an' I hope to goodness
as it won't come in the night, for
boardin' a editor has put me all at outs
with night work."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;" said Mrs. Lathrop.</p>

<p>"Well, if you say so, I'll believe it," said

<h1>THE REJUVENATION
OF AUNT MARY</h1>
<p class="center">By ANNE WARNER</p>

<p class="center">Author of "Susan Clegg and Her Friend Mrs. Lathrop,"
"A Woman's Will," etc.</p>

<p>This very clever and original story by the creator of
"Susan Clegg" will add materially to her reputation as
a writer of popular fiction. "Aunt Mary" and her
adventures in New York are simply delicious; and her
nephew, Jack, and his college friends, who personally
conduct her through the metropolis, are brimful of
brightness and humor. A pretty love story runs through
the book. "Aunt Mary's" magazine d&eacute;but delighted
thousands of readers, and the publication of the story in
a more permanent form, with new chapters, and scenes,
will increase her popularity.</p>

<p>Anne Warner takes her place in the circle of American
woman humorists, who have achieved distinction so rapidly
within recent years.&mdash;<i>Brooklyn Eagle</i>.</p>

<p>Anne Warner is not only a funmaker but adds to that the
quality of sympathy with her characters.&mdash;<i>Public Opinion</i>.</p>

<p class="center">Author of "Susan Clegg and Her Friend Mrs. Lathrop."</p>

<p>It is a relief to take up a volume so absolutely free from
stressfulness. The love-making is passionate, the
humor of much of the conversation is thoroughly delightful.
The book is as refreshing a bit of fiction as one often finds;
there is not a dull page in it.&mdash;<i>Providence Journal</i>.</p>

<p>It is bright, charming, and intense as it describes the
wooing of a young American widow on the European
Continent by a German musical genius.&mdash;<i>San Francisco
Chronicle</i>.</p>

<p>A deliciously funny book.&mdash;<i>Chicago Tribune</i>.</p>

<p>There is a laugh on nearly every page.&mdash;<i>New York Times</i>.</p>

<p>Most decidedly an unusual story. The dialogue is nothing
if not original, and the characters are very unique. There
is something striking on every page of the book.&mdash;<i>Newark
Advertiser</i>.</p>

<p>A more vivacious light novel could not be found.&mdash;<i>Chicago
Record-Herald</i>.</p>
